<p>Although many of Havel’s poems were whimsical “concrete” poems, a good number were pointedly critical of Czechoslovakian society and politics of the time. These works, along with his other dissident activities, landed him in jail from 1979 until 1984.</p>

<p>February this year saw the death of the Polish poet and Nobel laureate, <a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/340">Wislawa Szymborska</a>, whose poems chronicled Polish history from WWII, through Stalinism and beyond. “My poems are strictly not political. They are more about people and life,” Szymborska once remarked, “but, of course, life crosses politics.”</p>

<p>Feminists – and certain political regimes – have long believed that the personal can be very political indeed. It’s a message reiterated by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/books/adrienne-rich-feminist-poet-and-author-dies-at-82.html?pagewanted=all">Adrienne Rich</a>, one of America’s most influential contemporary poets, whose poetry books have sold close to a million copies.</p>

<p>As a woman and a lesbian of Jewish descent, Rich was concerned with the politics of identity long before the idea became de rigueur. Poetry is a map, she declares in her poem, “Dreamwood”: not a revolution, “but a way of knowing / why it must come”. Rich’s death on 27 March dispatched a wave of mourning around the world.</p>

<p>The marriage between poetry and politics has a long history. <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/32798/Archilochus">Archilochus</a> wrote some of the earliest political poetry, and Horace’s tribute to Augustus’s principate in the <em><a href="http://www.classicalresourcecentre.com/articles/046.htm">Roman Odes</a></em> is among the greatest political poetry ever written.</p>

<p>While much of the earliest political poetry was written in tribute to leaders, much of contemporary political poetry is written in protest.</p>

<p>Robert Hass, American poet laureate (1995-97), <a href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/haas/onlineinterviews.htm">elucidates</a> the contemporary view: “I think the job of poetry, its political job, is to refresh the idea of justice, which is going dead in us all the time."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, political poetry can be difficult for the critic to esteem. Harold Bloom held it to the highest measure in his attack on <em><a href="http://www.bestamericanpoetry.com/pages/volumes/?id=1996">The Best American Poetry 1996</a></em> anthology, edited by Adrienne Rich, calling it “a stuffed owl of bad verse”. He was unable, he claimed, to find in it more than an authentic poem or two.</p>

<p>“It is of a badness not to be believed, because it follows the criteria now operative: what matters most are the race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, and political purpose of the would-be poet. Sincerity, as the divine Oscar Wilde assured us, is not nearly enough to generate a poem.”</p>

<p>Yet sincerity is precisely the stuff of which <a href="http://www.gdansk-life.com/poland/gunter-grass">Günter Grass</a>’ incendiary poem, “<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/apr/05/gunter-grass-what-must-be-said">What Must Be Said</a>”, is made. The poem’s argument is two-fold. First, Israel’s nuclear arsenal is a threat to the Iranian people and “endangers an already fragile world peace”;</p>

<p>Second it argues why for a long time he has felt unable to voice his fears owing to a greater fear of being punished for the sins of his German forefathers:</p>

<p>“But why have I kept silent till now?</p>

<p>Because I thought my own origins,</p>

<p>tarnished by a stain that can never be removed,</p>

<p>meant I could not expect Israel, a land</p>

<p>to which I am, and always will be, attached,</p>

<p>to accept this open declaration of the truth."</p>

<p>Despite his declared attachment to Israel, Grass was right to worry. The poem caused a <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/israels-fighting-democracy-a-few-things-that-need-saying-6123">tremendous ruckus</a> when it appeared on 4 April in several European newspapers.</p>

<p>It demonstrated decisively that poetry can “<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2009/11/poetry-makes-nothing-happen-or-does-it/">make things happen</a>” after all, on 8 April Israel declared Grass a persona non grata and denied him future entry into the country.</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="http://www.news24.com/World/News/Israel-derides-shameful-German-poem-20120405">said</a> the poem’s allegation that Israel poses a greater threat to world security than Iran – “a regime which denies the Holocaust and calls for Israel’s destruction” – is a “shameful moral equivalence”.</p>

<p>Grass was quick to apologise for the wording in his poem: instead of saying Israel, he should have said “the Netanyahu government”.</p>

<p>Despite the brouhaha the poem has incited, most critics agree it isn’t particularly good. Heather Horn, who translated it from German, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/gunter-grasss-controversial-poem-about-israel-iran-and-war-translated/255549/">chided</a> its “needlessly Teutonic constructions” and “winding and parenthetical tone”.</p>

<p>Someone once said publishing a poem is like throwing a feather off a cliff and waiting for the thud. In Grass’ case the feather turned out to be an elephant and he was standing under it.</p>

<p>The absurdity of fuss generated by an average-at-best poem would be amusing, were it not for the toll it appears to have taken on Grass’s health.</p>

<p>On Monday this week – two weeks after the poem’s publication – Grass was admitted with suspected heart problems to a hospital in Hamburg. “There’s no danger to his life,” his doctor said in a written statement, assuring the world that the 84 year-old poet would return home by “the end of the week at the latest.”</p>

<p>In some societies – past and, sadly, some  present – poets pay with their lives for the gall of social critique.</p>

<p>Putting politics aside, let’s hope Günter Grass’s price will not be so costly.</p><p><em>Bronwyn Lea does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.</em></p><img src="//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/6514/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/conversationedu/~4/cZp2NWl_Lx8" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>Comedian <a href="http://www.brownplanet.com.au/bio.html">Aamer Rahman</a> summed up the rise and implosion of the Kony2012 campaign when he said people who’d posted the <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc">Youtube video</a> on his Facebook feed had often asked him, “Don’t you believe children should be children?” He answered in the affirmative – yes, he did believe such things.</p>

<p>But what he had trouble swallowing was the idea that a “Kony wristband woven together by fairies out of rainbows and unicorn hair magically changes the destiny of Africa every time a white person buys one on the internet.”</p>

<p>In his <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms9cLR1mwrk">humorous criticism</a>
 of the Kony 2012 saga, Rahman has pointed to a serious question of his own: what value is there in good intentions, if they aren’t backed up by effective methods and followed up by concrete results? When the campaign spread like lightning through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KONY20121">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Invisible">Twitter</a>, I initially <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/in-defence-of-the-bandwagon-kony-2012-makers-should-check-their-facts-but-so-should-critics-5773">welcomed</a> the fact that young people were interested in it, and preferred links to the video over posts about the Kardashians or Justin Bieber.</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9817/width668/ygqhybt4-1334898300.jpg"><figcaption>Kony 2012 merchandise <span class="source">Flickr/theperplexingparadox</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>I thought the campaign was audacious in a good way, because it was effective in its smash-and-grab use of social media to draw attention to its cause. Since the video went viral, the African Union has announced a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/5000-extra-troops-hunt-kony-in-jungle-7584083.html">taskforce of 5000 soldiers</a> to focus on the Lord’s Resistance army and two resolutions were passed by the US congress, endorsing the capture of Joseph Kony.</p>

<p>But since then, some very valid questions have been asked about the organisation behind Kony2012 – for example, in relation to its finances, its politics and – critically – its reliance of a “white man’s burden” narrative and apparent lack of agency towards the Africans it purported to help.</p>

<p>More pepole throughout the world now know who Joseph Kony is, and it’s likely that the organisation behind the campaign has learned a thing or two about transparency.</p>

<p><figure class="align-left"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9816/width237/883v9dxg-1334898108.jpg"><figcaption>Kony 2012 <span class="source">EPA/Stuart Price / Pool</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>But is that enough of an end result? My RMIT colleague <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/browse/About%20RMIT%2FContact%20Us%2FStaff%2Fby%20name%2FJ%2F;ID=8pd9ryltsjhw1;STATUS=A">Terry Johal</a>  believes the role of <a href="http://cityjournal.dsc.rmit.edu.au/2011/09/15/the-social-network-revolution-fallacy/">social media</a> in civil unrest is over-stated, and Kony2012 could be seen as the latest manifestation of technology playing a part in civil action.</p>

<p>Before social media existed, the use of text messaging in protests brought down a <a href="http://www.movements.org/case-study/entry/people-power-ii-in-the-philippines/">Philippines president</a>. Email lists mobilised demonstrators before the end of the <a href="http://www.cios.org/EJCPUBLIC/014/3/01437.html">New Order regime</a> in Indonesia. One of the first ways the world found out about what was happening in Tiananmen Square in China twenty years ago was through <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957964,00.html">fax machine</a>.</p>

<p>Most recently pro- and anti- Assad groups have been using <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Syrian-revolution-videos-with-English-subtitles/175166529205140">Facebook</a> as a medium to spread videos in support of their positions. But in each of these circumstances, the use of technology seemed to be grassroots.</p>

<p>The text messages, fax machines, email lists and most recently Facebook videos were a natural evolution of strengthening an existing message and cause. Perhaps it was the deliberate, almost cynical appropriation of social media by Kony2012 that made it appear less genuine than these earlier cases, and more open to discrediting.</p>

<p>Revolutions are not made by technology alone – there were two aspects to Kony2012.</p>

<p>Invisible Children have now given us a textbook example of how to effectively use a specific media to target an audience comprised of digital natives. After all, they were responsible for the most viral video in all of the internet’s short history.</p>

<p>But it’s the offline activities and consequences of the use of technology that also plays a part. In this instance, Kony2012 could also – because of the stumbles and the problems with the offline component of the campaign – be read as a missed opportunity.</p><p><em>Nasya Bahfen works for RMIT</em></p><img src="//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/6580/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/conversationedu/~4/s9ZlhKy2HkY" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>This decision is the culmination of the last few years of litigation by the Australian Federation against Copyright Theft (AFACT), in conjunction with 34 movie studios. They sought to argue that iiNet, which is Australia’s second largest internet service provider, was liable for copyright infringement when its users used their home internet connections to download and upload movies using the BitTorrent protocol.</p>

<p>The High Court has found in line with the lower level court decisions that iiNet was not responsible for the actions of its users. The evidence before the court was that iiNet hadn’t done anything beyond providing the internet connection. The High Court found in order to be liable something more is required – iiNet cannot be liable for merely being inactive in response to allegations of infringement of copyright made by AFACT. Importantly, the High Court ruled that it would not be reasonable to expect iiNet to disconnect the accounts of its users solely on the allegations of infringement provided by AFACT.</p>

<p><strong>What are the implications of this decision? Other internet service providers will no doubt be watching with great interest.</strong></p>

<p>It’s a very important decision worldwide. We’ve only seen a few of these decisions so far. There was one in the Irish High courts where the Irish ISP Eircom was found liable for infringement on its network.</p>

<p>This decision in Australia is the most considered decision that we have seen in common law countries. It represents the next iteration of an attempt by copyright owners to enlist the aid of internet service providers to police infringement on the internet.</p>

<p>Over the past 15 years, copyright owners have had trouble using litigation to deter copyright infringement. They started off targeting companies like Napster and Kazaa, who were clearly encouraging the infringement of copyright by developing peer-to-peer file sharing networks that were designed to allow people to share copyrighted materials.</p>

<p>Then those technologies started to become decentralised and the copyright owners found they could not sue the developers of technologies like BitTorrent because they are such widely used general-purpose protocols, and they couldn’t sue end users because it tends to be terribly expensive, terribly unpopular, unfair and, realistically, quite ineffective.</p>

<p>So most recently, they have been trying to impose a duty on domestic ISPs to police infringement on the network. This approach is attractive because ISPs are quite big targets and, by imposing regulation at that point, they can potentially have quite a strong flow-on effect on the ability to control what users are actually doing.</p>

<p>This is quite an important decision worldwide because a lot of different countries are trying to look for different ways to target infringement and trying to sort out the principles on which ISPs should and should not be required to police what is on their network.</p>

<p>France had a quite controversial three strikes regime, which was struck down by the Constitutional Court and, in the end, was recast as a more limited and legitimate judicial regime. Both the UK and NZ have also introduced controversial “graduated response” regimes, where users will be progressively warned and potentially have their internet accounts terminated when they are found to have infringed copyright. The US has not gone so far, but the major ISPs have agreed with copyright owners to introduce some form of private notification scheme.</p>

<p><strong>What about here in Australia?</strong></p>

<p>Here in Australia this was seen as a test case to see if ISPs already have a duty to police Australian internet users under the law. It was quite ambitious in that the duty to terminate is not explicit under Australian law. The questions was whether or not ISPs that did nothing more than provide a connection could be liable. If they were, that would impose on them an obligation to do something about copyright infringement – although AFACT was never quite clear on what exactly it expected ISPs to do.</p>

<p><strong>So what will the next move be from copyright owners?</strong></p>

<p>I think two things may happen. This decision provides a good deal of certainty to Australian ISPs under current law, so copyright owners will likely increase pressure on policy makers to develop a new legislative regime. Copyright owners are still looking for a way that they can enlist the help of intermediaries such as ISPs to police copyright infringements, although such regimes are often highly controversial. It is unclear at this stage whether the federal government will entertain copyright industry demands for a three-strikes or similar system in Australia, particularly in the face of strong public opposition worldwide. At any rate, little is expected to change before the Australian Law Reform Commission completes its review of the copyright system near the end of 2013.</p>

<p>We are also starting see the emergence of an acknowledgement by copyright owners that it is important to develop business models which provide consumers with cheap, high quality and fast access to entertainment and other copyright material. The one thing that has worked in last 15 years is increasing access: models like iTunes, Amazon’s Kindle, and Netflix have been able to successfully provide a legitimate and convenient alternative to infringing filesharing.</p><p><em>Nicolas Suzor has received funding from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Creative Industries and Innovation to research graduated response schemes in copyright law.

<p>Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson said the protest activity at energy facilities could perhaps have “life-threatening” and “major trade and investment implications”.</p>

<p>Documents have confirmed the Australian government is exploring ways to better utilise the security and intelligence community in order to support the coal and energy sectors in handling climate change activists.</p>

<p>But are protest groups who might disturb energy infrastructure within Australia a genuine national security threat – a sort of home-grown, green-tinted al-Qaeda?</p>

<p>And in a free society, how far should society extend the mandate of the intelligence sector to monitor environmental and conservation groups?</p>

<h2>Terrorists or protesters?</h2>

<p>Shortly after the reports in the Fairfax media, the Australian Mining website ran a story with the provocative title – “<a href="http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/green-groups-are-worse-than-terrorists--government">Green groups are worse than terrorists: Government</a>”.</p>

<p>Green groups have responded with a mix of shock and outrage. Some argue that the label “terrorist” has become improvised political rhetoric, a trigger for anything to inspire public backlash and justify heavy-handed retaliation.</p>

<p>Others claim that security resources are being pointlessly wasted in expanded attempts to quash democratic demonstrations.</p>

<p>Australian Greens Senator Scott Ludlam <a href="http://greens.org.au/content/minister-using-asio-spy-behest-fossil-fuel-lobby-must-be-held-account-0">stated</a> that it was “a deliberate abuse of the role of Australian security agencies, who have better things to do than follow the dictates of foreign coal and energy corporations”.</p>

<p>In contrast, supporters argue it is clear that ASIO does have an important role to play in real-time surveillance of citizens and their activities. Particularly when there is the potential for industrial sabotage and the physical destruction of critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Security officials have also been cited as expressing concern about future plans by environmental groups to “disrupt and delay” coal and energy industry development. More broadly, “knowing your enemy” to assist decision-making options in government has been viewed as obligatory to “winning” the so-called war on terrorism.</p>

<h2>Genuine risk?</h2>

<p>But a key question is whether green groups involved in public protests in Australia should be isolated as a real or potential terrorist-type risk that might be prone to violent campaigning? Critically how should such a threat assessment be constructed?</p>

<p>Certainly, the relationship between intelligence and policy is complex and delicate. And the term terrorism itself does remain a highly emotive and subjective term.</p>

<p>In a post-9/11 world, there has been an immense political pressure to drastically alter the environment in which intelligence operates. As part of this shift, executive branches now have less rigid oversight, while methods of intelligence and policing have been hardened. This has been echoed in a wide range of democratic nations.</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9775/width668/n7f5j3xx-1334814133.jpg"><figcaption>Greenpeace activists attaching themselves to the Hay Point coal terminal in an attempt to stop the loading of coal in 2009. <span class="source">AAP</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Indeed, after 9/11, there has been no shortage of pressure on policy leaders to push to reclaim “lost” executive security powers and promoting a reorganisation of intelligence duties.</p>

<h2>A matter of trust</h2>

<p>But past events have shown us that the public can not always trust executive conduct or the executive’s relationship with the security sector.</p>

<p>The history here has been troubled to say the least. Public trust has been exploited to reflect a tale of legal ambiguity, managerial breakdown, negligence in standard procedures and domestic human rights abuses.</p>

<p>Of course, since the Cold War, unauthorised operations are virtually non-existent in liberal democracies. But there is no doubt that the reliability of executive power and related public support for the intelligence community remains a highly contentious issue.</p>

<p>Alarm bells were raised during bipartisan investigations into intelligence operations and constitutional rights in both America and Australia during the 1970s and 1980s. In that period, an ambitious policy platform for offensive security strategies and target hardening had been badly undermined – particularly due to legislative backlash and media investigations after Vietnam and Watergate.</p>

<p>US intelligence, for example, had actively harassed and constrained political “enemies”, civil society groups and social dissenters engaged in lawful political activities.
Such intelligence activity included the monitoring of university professors, anti-Vietnam War protesters and civil rights activists such as Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

<p>In the words of then US Senator Frank Church, an intensification of surveillance on citizens was being “collected and disseminated in order to serve the purely political interests of an intelligence agency or the administration, and to influence social policy and political action”.</p>

<h2>Cause for concern</h2>

<p>Today, the responsibility should remain wirh the policymaker – the consumer of intelligence – to resist falsely classifying information while also setting and managing security priorities that are based on credible risk assessments.</p>

<p>We should remember the words of US Senator Wyche Fowler. He argued that a balance of power that was distributed to democratic institutions was meant to keep politicians on their toes, and “bureaucrats from doing something stupid”.</p><p><em>Daniel Baldino does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.</em></p><img src="//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/6523/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/conversationedu/~4/HNX0xch-gbU" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>The latest polls show that right-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy and his centre-left contender François Hollande are set to win their ticket to the second round.</p>

<p>While both candidates are currently polling in the high 20s, an upset is not entirely ruled out. The campaign has also shown strong support for three main outsiders: centre <a href="http://www.uk.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/uk-france-election-bayrou-idUKBR83G0TX20120417">François Bayrou</a>, but more importantly hard left <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/03/galloway-melenchon-expose-gap">Jean-Luc Mélenchon</a> and extreme right <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28210/Marine_LE%20PEN.html">Marine Le Pen</a>.</p>

<h2>Sarkozy’s run to the right</h2>

<p>While Hollande has so far refused to embrace more left-wing politics, Sarkozy has made a clear move to recuperate Le Pen’s electorate.</p>

<p>His attempts have not gone unnoticed and have attracted strong criticism from across the globe. The Wall Street Journal has even called him “<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304450004577277241473592360.html?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_opinion">Nicolas Le Pen</a>”.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/infographe/2012/02/21/presidentielle-2012-comparez-toutes-les-intentions-de-vote_1637470_1471069.html">Opinion polls</a> now show Sarkozy in front for the first time. Le Pen’s support meanwhile has slumped from a high of 19% in October last year, to 14% in early April.</p>

<p>Sarkozy’s strategy is not surprising and could well prove successful. Prior to March when ratings were poor, Sarkozy’s re-election seemed at best improbable. He appeared unable to reignite the fervour of 2007 which had given him a strong mandate.</p>

<p>After four years in power many of those who had turned to the hyper-active president felt disappointed, and were planning to return to their traditional voting patterns or to abstention.</p>

<h2>Populist politics</h2>

<p>The centrality of populist politics were reemphasised in Sarkozy’s campaign following Le Pen’s Front National upset the ruling Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) during the 2011 <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2011/03/21/cantonales-des-resultats-historiques-pour-le-front-national_1496046_823448.html">county elections</a>.</p>

<p>This was demonstrated by the nomination of radical right advisor <a href="http://www.rue89.com/2011/03/09/les-annees-minute-de-patrick-buisson-conseiller-de-sarkozy-194143">Patrick Buisson</a>, and the media saturation organised by special advisor Henry Guaino and Minister of the Interior and Immigration Claude Guéant. Both played a major part in Sarkozy’s 2007 populist victory.</p>

<p>Guaino has made Sarkozy’s new position <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/breve/2012/02/24/l-immigration-est-un-probleme-guaino-assume-ses-propos_1647876_1471069.html">clear</a>; “it is true that in a society in crisis, immigration is a problem”.</p>

<p>Guéant refutes the idea that this position is linked to xenophobia. He argues <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2011/03/15/claude-gueant-le-fn-ne-nous-sert-pas-de-boussole_1493265_823448.html#ens_id=1494805ad">instead</a> that it is natural for the French to “want France to remain France”.</p>

<p>For Guaino, the <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/article/2012/03/31/henri-guaino-ne-pas-prendre-en-compte-les-passions-populaires-expose-a-la-colere_1678568_1471069.html">importance</a> of the 2012 elections was reminiscent of Le Pen’s apocalyptic rhetoric. <a href="http://www.rue89.com/rue89-presidentielle/2012/02/05/civilisations-marine-le-pen-moins-provocatrice-que-gueant-229106">Outbidding</a> Le Pen herself, he <a href="http://www.rue89.com/2012/02/04/gueant-t-il-vraiment-dit-toutes-les-civilisatiosn-ne-se-valent-pas-229090">added</a> an undeniably neo-racist tone to his rhetoric, when he declared that “all civilisations are not equal in worth”.</p>

<p>Guéant clarified that he was not targeting any culture in particular, but quickly highlighted the importance of banning the hijab in public, as well as street prayers.</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9756/width668/7c8wxmwf-1334795448.jpg"><figcaption>Immigration and multiculturalism are key platforms of Le Pen's National Front <span class="source">EPA/Ian Langsdon</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Sarkozy has described the proposition to grant foreigners the right to vote in local elections as a “blow to the Republic”, linking his strange reasoning to the burqa issue. For Guéant, it would lead to “compulsory halal food in the meals served in school cafeterias”.</p>

<p>Sarkozy added, “there are too many foreigners on our territory”, and promised to halve immigration.</p>

<h2>Targeting the weak</h2>

<p>Borrowing further from Le Pen, Sarkozy attempts to present himself as the candidate of the “rupture”, or of the people against the elite. To achieve this, many populist proposals have been added to the campaign.</p>

<p>While recently <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/article/2012/02/16/quand-sarkozy-theorisait-son-opposition-au-referendum_1643949_1471069.html#ens_id=1588921">opposed</a> to the idea of referenda, Sarkozy <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2012/article/2012/02/22/nicolas-sarkozy-le-referendum-est-une-grande-proposition_1647037_1471069.html#ens_id=1627704">proposed</a> in his campaign to ask “the people” whether unemployment benefits should be reformed to force the unemployed back into work.</p>

<p>That <a href="http://www.rue89.com/2012/02/29/ils-ont-droit-aux-aides-sociales-mais-ne-les-demandent-pas-229797">half of those eligible</a> do not claim the minimal unemployment benefits escaped Sarkozy’s populist discourse. Instead, he singled out the most defenceless in society as innately lazy and profiteering from taxpayers’ money.</p>

<p>With less than a week to go until the first round, Sarkozy has made it clear that he will be relying on the extreme right vote. To assuage the fears of his more moderate electorate, some of his advisers have noted that his campaign for the second round would be more centrist.</p>

<p>Supporting the <a href="http://www.who.int/fctc/en/"><em>WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</em></a>, the Australian Parliament has passed <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011A00148"><em>The Tobacco Plain Packaging Act</em> 2011 (Cth)</a>. The legislation was supported by all the major parties.</p>

<p>Labor Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, argued, “Plain packaging means that the glamour is gone from smoking and cigarettes are now exposed for what they are: killer products that destroy thousands of Australian families.”</p>

<p>The leader of the Coalition Opposition, Tony Abbott, acknowledged: “This is an important health measure. It’s important to get smoking rates down further.” The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yngarPkH6Fs">Greens</a> also supported the measure – and called for the Future Fund to end its tobacco investments.</p>

<p>In response, Japan Tobacco International and British American Tobacco brought legal action against the government in the High Court of Australia, claiming that the Act amounts to an acquisition of property on less than just terms under the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00469"><em>Australian Constitution</em></a>. Phillip Morris Ltd and Imperial Tobacco joined the case, and supported their fellow tobacco companies.</p>

<p>In its defence, the Commonwealth was supported by the governments of the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/s389-2012/BAT_AGACT.pdf">Australian Capital Territory</a>, the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/s389-2012/BAT_AGNT.pdf">Northern Territory</a>, and <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/s389-2012/BAT_AGQld.pdf">Queensland</a>. The <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/s389-2012/BAT_CancerSubs.pdf">Cancer Council Australia</a> made written submissions, but was not given leave to intervene.</p>

<p>The High Court of Australia heard arguments over three days from the April 17 to 19, 2012. The various parties enlisted battalions of lawyers, the proceedings received intense media attention, and the public galleries were packed. Here’s how it went.</p>

<p><strong>Big Tobacco’s arguments</strong></p>

<p>Tobacco companies struggled with their argument that the introduction of the plain packaging of tobacco products amounted to an acquisition of property on less than just terms.</p>

<p>There was much discussion as to whether the Commonwealth had indeed effected an “acquisition” of the tobacco trade marks. Japan Tobacco International’s barrister argued, “The Commonwealth law by its terms abrogates the power to substitute any message the Commonwealth chooses on what we say is our billboard.”</p>

<p>The tobacco companies argued for a broad view of property under the Australian Constitution, and claimed to hold various forms of intellectual property in relation to tobacco packaging, including trade marks, patents, designs, copyright and passing-off.</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9799/width668/b5qcgpzx-1334884965.jpg"><figcaption>Has plain packaging extinguished tobacco companies' intellectual property? <span class="source">AAPIMAGE/Alan Porrit</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Their barristers said the intellectual property rights of tobacco companies had been extinguished, or at least severely impaired. One said, “On our analysis, everything has been taken.”</p>

<p>There was much debate about the semiotics of tobacco packaging and clear <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/plain-packaging-a-drag-say-big-tobaccos-top-silks-20120417-1x5p9.html">festishization of the tobacco pack</a>. The judges were invited to closely inspect the packaging of tobacco products. And there was a discussion of the use of words, colours, emblems, badges, and logos – with references to examples such as Camel cigarettes.</p>

<p>But the judges questioned the analogies drawn between property cases, dealing with land, and intellectual property cases on the acquisition of property. Justice Gummow asked, “Are any of these cases about intangibles? A lot of the American cases are about land, are they not?” It was surprising that there was relatively little discussion about past Australian precedents on intellectual property and constitutional law, such as the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/HCA/2000/14.html">Grain Pool</a> case, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/HCA/1993/10.html">Blank Tapes</a> case, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/HCA/1994/27.html">Nintendo</a> case, and the recent <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/HCA/2012/8.html">Phonographic</a> ruling.</p>

<p>Tobacco companies wanted to draw a distinction between graphic health warnings and “excessive regulation” (plain packaging). Justice Kiefel responded, “The degree of regulation may be extremely restrictive and yet there be no acquisition.”</p>

<p>British American Tobacco argued tobacco companies should receive compensation for public health advertisements. “The fact that it is an improving message or a good message may be socially desirable and if it is then the Commonwealth should pay for it,” they argued.</p>

<p>As a witness to the proceedings and an expert in intellectual property, the arguments of the tobacco companies about acquisition of property often seemed synthetic and unreal to me.</p>

<p><strong>The Commonwealth</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/s389-2012/BAT_Def.pdf">Commonwealth government</a> mounted a strong defence of the legality and constitutionality of the plain packaging of tobacco products. Their submissions explained the measures were “directed to informing, redressing and reducing harm to the public health that is caused by use of the tobacco products.”</p>

<p>The solicitor-general for the Commonwealth, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-boy-from-sandy-hollow/2009/01/09/1231004286973.html">Stephen Gageler</a>, argued the law was “no different in principle from any other specification of a product standard or an information standard for products or, indeed, services that are to become the subject of trade in the future.”</p>

<p>He observed, “The product information required to be placed on these products differs only in intensity from product information that is routinely mandated to accompany therapeutic goods, industrial chemicals, poisons and other products injurious to the public health”. He commented, “The mandatory graphic health warnings are the skull and crossbones for a digital age, nothing more.”</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9805/width668/6qz23t8f-1334889303.jpg"><figcaption><span class="source">AAPIMAGE/James Lane</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The Solicitor-General said that “to suggest that the tobacco packages become little billboards for government advertising is wrong.” He denied the government was engaged in advertising, or derived any such benefit, and contended that a regulatory norm of conduct was not an acquisition of property.</p>

<p>The government stressed the sale and packaging of cigarettes had long been regulated in Australia, and that plain packaging was but the latest step in this process.</p>

<p>The solicitor-general argued the statutory rights of intellectual property are often varied and modified, adding a trademark “must at least be subject to a subsequent prohibition on use to prevent harm to the public or to public health”. Indeed, Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm0_e.htm"><em>TRIPS Agreement</em> 1994</a> recognises that “members may, in formulating or amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health and nutrition”.</p>

<p>Solicitor-general also argued that the concept of just terms raised larger questions of fairness and justice under the constitution.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth maintained that it would be incongruous to compensate Big Tobacco, “For the Australian nation representing the Australian community to be required to compensate tobacco companies for the loss resulting from no longer being able to continue in the harmful use of their property goes beyond the requirements of any reasonable notion of fairness.”</p>

<p><strong>Sideshows: margarine, boxes and Ratsak</strong></p>

<p>Notwithstanding its serious subject matter, the case also had its colourful moments.</p>

<p>An amusing esoteric sideshow in the case was the fierce battle between junior lawyers  over legal history relevant to the case. There was discussion of the <em>Margarine Act</em> of 1887 (United Kingdom), which required the plain packaging of margarine and margarine-cheese. But there were no reports of 19th century margarine and margarine-cheese makers ever ran litigation over plain packaging.</p>

<p>There has been much debate about absurd patent applications of late. And in this case, British American Tobacco revealed that it has filed patent applications for packages for tobacco products. Here’s the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/portal/index.html.en">WIPO</a> version of British American Tobacco’s suspect <a href="http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/search/en/WO2011023983">patent application</a> for a “soft cup package for tobacco products”.</p>

<p>What is novel, inventive or useful about a soft cup package for tobacco products?  Patent law should be encouraging the progress of science and the useful arts – treatments and therapies for cancer, for instance – rather than cigarette boxes.</p>

<p><figure class="align-left"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9811/width237/yyqxjtgs-1334895972.jpg"><figcaption>Tobacco company lawyers compared warning on Ratsak (rat poison) with warnings on tobacco products. <span class="source">http://www.ratsak.com.au/</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Another oddity was the frequent comparisons between warnings on Ratsak poison, and health warnings on tobacco products, which gave the case a peculiar ending. The barrister for Japan Tobacco International invited the seven judges of the High Court of Australia to inspect the labelling on Ratsak, which he had bought at local shops.</p>

<p><strong>A brilliant Australian idea</strong></p>

<p>The High Court of Australia has reserved its decision. A ruling can be expected later in the year.</p>

<p>French CJ signalled that he thought that the matter of tobacco was <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/opinion/political-news/big-tobacco-grilled-in-high-court-20120418-1x6vs.html">exceptional</a>. “None of these cases… involve somebody putting into the marketplace a substance which places at risk of serious and fatal disease. We are talking about something in quite a different category, are we not?” he asked.</p>

<p>The case provides the court with an opportunity to contemplate the constitutional role of the Commonwealth in regulating and protection health.</p>

<p>In terms of larger principles, the High Court of Australia can provide guidance on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the difference between acquisition of property and regulation;</p></li>
<li><p>the relationship between property and intellectual property; and</p></li>
<li><p>the standard of justice underlying just terms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the ruling will have larger implications for the labelling of therapeutic goods, food, alcohol, and beverages, such as soft drinks.</p>

<p>What we know for certain is that, far from heralding the end of the fight about plain packaging, this case is merely one battle in an ongoing war for better public health.</p>

<p>But it will certainly have wider international implications. <a href="http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/latest-news/plain-packaging-will--win---robertson">Geoffrey Robertson QC</a>has predicted that, not only will the Commonwealth win the case, but other countries will follow the “brilliant Australian idea”. Both <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/6774918/Plain-packets-to-be-introduced-to-cigarettes">New Zealand</a> and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/apr/13/cigarettes-plain-packets-branding-ban">England</a> have initiated public consultation processes, with a view to establishing schemes for the plain packaging of tobacco products.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other attempts by tobacco companies to thwart this measure will continue. Big Tobacco will no doubt seek to challenge plain packaging in a wide array of arenas. The Ukraine, for instance, is leading <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-17/ukraine-uses-wto-to-challenge-australias-tobacco/3956358">a misconceived challenge</a> to Australia’s plain packaging of tobacco products under the <em>TRIPS Agreement</em> 1994. And, there’s a <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/big-tobacco-accused-of-legal-trick-20111221-1p5qv.html">contrived action</a> against Australia’s scheme under an investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia.</p>

<p>Health activists are also concerned about Big Tobacco’s involvement in the development of free trade agreements, such as the <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/opening-pandoras-box-secret-treaty-threatens-human-rights-6092">Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement</a> and the <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/australia-should-defend-neighbours-in-trans-pacific-partnership-negotiations-5902">Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement</a>. There are fears that such treaties will include parts aimed at undermining tobacco control measures.</p>

<p>The Conversation’s aged care and health policy experts have unpacked the report and share their thoughts below.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Colleen Doyle, Principal Research Fellow in Service Development and Evaluation at University of Melbourne</strong></p>

<p>The reforms announced by the government today are welcome and in line with preferences expressed by older Australians – both in research and in government consultations – to be able to live in their own homes with adequate support for as long as possible.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.agedcareaustralia.gov.au/internet/agedcare/publishing.nsf/content/EACHD">Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia packages</a> that were introduced by the government in 2005 recognised that a substantial proportion, at least one third, of people receiving aged care support while living at home were also living with dementia. The program was <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ageing-dementia-evaluation">evaluated</a> independently and indicated that the services provided led to improved quality of life for recipients.</p>

<p>Participants in the evaluation at that time expressed preferences for more services for people at earlier stages of dementia. The reform announced today, which allows a <strong>dementia</strong> supplement to be paid to people receiving community care, will be a good step toward greater support for people at an earlier stage of dementia.</p>

<p>People who access support services as early as possible have better outcomes than people who, for any reason, delay accessing services. So encouraging people to start accepting small amounts of support will help to maintain function for as long as possible and lead to better outcomes for individuals. This increase in service support needs to be supplemented with increased awareness in the community about how best to care for people with dementia.</p>

<p>The Aged Care <strong>workforce</strong> is critical to maintaining adequate quality of care for older Australians. The tertiary education sector has the responsibility to ensure that knowledge translation happens in this workforce. At present, the aged care sector has little incentive to be involved even though it has the potential to raise the standard of quality of care as well as ensure government-funded research is relevant to practice.</p>

<p>Further efforts need to be made in reducing the stigma associated with working in aged care by improving community attitudes to the sector.</p>

<p><strong>Stephen Leeder, Professor of Public Health and Director, Menzies Centre for Health Policy, University of Sydney</strong></p>

<p>The proposals for reforming how we pay for the support and care of older people seek to remedy currently anomalous and inequitable financial arrangements that privilege the rich. By expanding services to support those who wish to stay at home, but who otherwise may have to be cared for in an institution, the reforms recognise the frequently-stated preference of older people for home care.</p>

<p>With more flexibility about the size, timing and method of payment for personal contributions to institutional care, a more humane and equitable approach has been proposed. And it’s set to be implemented quickly.</p>

<p>Dementia care has received welcome recognition and funding has increased for this special category of aged support.</p>

<p>It is appropriate, and welcome, for the federal government to be reforming its approach to paying for aged care. It would, of course, be even better if this were set within a context of public debate and policy formation around the topic of aged care.</p>

<p>Precisely what are we aiming to do with aged care?</p>

<p>How much care is it reasonable for an Australian to expect?</p>

<p>How does residential care for people – especially those with multiple problems such as heart disease, arthritis and emphysema – fit with the health system, which is good at acute treatment but not designed for the drawn-out, decades-long experience of ageing?</p>

<p>And what do we make of dementia? I visit a 93 year old relative with dementia who is happy but has no short-term memory and speaks in riddles. What do we, as a society, make of the existence of such a person? How do we value them? These are big questions indeed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we have work to do. Our ageing population deserves a skilled workforce. We need to discuss how this workforce will be assembled. Geriatrics has traditionally had low levels of popularity as a medical career choice. And while other professions have done better, we need to make these careers more attractive. But without money, nothing will improve. So the increased funding, and changes to the distribution, are most welcome.</p>

<p>There’s not much fun about getting old. But it’s something everyone who cares about Australia’s values and the future of our society must confront – fun or not. Today’s announcements are a splendid endorsement of the efforts of dedicated bands of aged-care service providers, advocates and carers.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Macfarlane, Director of Aged Psychiatry at Caulfield Hospital &amp; Associate Professor of Psychiatry, Monash University</strong></p>

<p>The government’s proposal to tackle <strong>workforce</strong> issues in aged care allocates <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ageing-aged-care-review-measures-factsheet-11.htm">$1.2 billion over five years</a>, which, at first glance, promises to go some way toward addressing the <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/improving-care-for-dementia-patients-in-our-ailing-aged-care-system-6362">current financial disincentives</a> to enter a career in aged care. Most care within aged care facilities is currently provided by workers lacking advanced skills, so the lure of higher wages and improved career pathways is likely to help attract and retain a more skilled and motivated workforce to the sector.</p>

<p>Residents of aged care facilities can be difficult to care for, because of their combination of medical and cognitive impairments. This complexity should mandate a <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/improving-care-for-dementia-patients-in-our-ailing-aged-care-system-6362">specific staff mix</a> within facilities, with more higher-skilled registered nurses. Providers, otherwise, will inevitably opt for a (more highly paid) Personal Care Assistant because they’ll still much cheaper to employ than a (more highly paid) registered nurse.</p>

<p>Of possible concern from today’s announcements is the potential for increasingly onerous reporting requirements on staff in aged care facilities. Requirements for documentation of care currently consumes valuable time that would be better spent on providing that care.</p>

<p>It also remains unclear exactly what proportion of the funding will be new money, as opposed to existing funds redirected from the current <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/budget2011-flexfund-acworkforce08.htm">Aged Care Workforce Fund</a>.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement provides <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ageing-aged-care-review-measures-factsheet-10.htm">$268.4 million over five years</a> to tackle <strong>dementia</strong>. These are impressive figures at first glance, yet they equate to less than $200 of extra funding a year for each of the 269,000 individuals currently suffering from this disease. It also overlooks the inflationary effects that would occur during this time, which dilutes the package even further.</p>

<p>The package seems to ignore the reality that dementia and the aged care sector are inextricably linked, with more than half of residents in high-level care suffering from dementia. Workers across the sector, not just health professionals, therefore require better support and education in dementia-specific care.</p>

<p>It’s significant and appropriate that general practitioners are to receive additional funding to support them to make a more timely diagnosis of dementia. But one thing that’s missing is a re-evaluation of the current restrictions that require specialist clinicians to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease before the patient can be prescribed cognitive-enhancing drugs. If GPs are to be supported in making a diagnosis, yet remain unable to initiate treatment, you have to question the point of such reform.</p>

<p>The package rightly observes that dementia remains under-diagnosed in hospitals, and provides <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ageing-aged-care-review-measures-factsheet-10.htm">$39.2 million</a> to address this problem. But the day-to-day pressures hospitals face in treating a growing number of patients means they’re not best placed to manage new diagnoses, even if they’re better able to make them. Instead, a more appropriate use of funds might be to detect the patient’s cognitive impairment in the hospital and then refer them to their GP for a definitive diagnosis.</p>

<p>The provision of <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ageing-aged-care-review-measures-factsheet-10.htm">$23.6 million</a> to support those with younger-onset dementia is welcomed, but seems poorly targeted. The ideal of enabling “younger people with dementia to actively participate through the development and dissemination of information for employers” seems to ignore the sad reality that younger-onset dementia tends to progress rapidly. Surely this money could be better spent, perhaps by the development of residential care settings that are geared towards the specific care needs of younger people.</p>

<p>The proposed reform of the <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/improving-care-for-dementia-patients-in-our-ailing-aged-care-system-6362">Aged Care Funding Instrument</a> to encompass items that reflect the care needs of those suffering high level behavioural disturbances is most welcome.</p><p><em>Colleen Doyle received funding from Department of Health and Ageing for the evaluation of the Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia packages.</em></p>

It’s a familiar refrain for anyone who has read a newspaper in the last 15 years.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/norway-killer-sharpened-aim-with-video-games-20120420-1xas3.html">the media reporting surrounding the trial</a> of accused mass-murderer <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/search?q=anders+breivik">Anders Breivik</a> has dusted off this old chestnut to explain a shooting spree and bomb attack that claimed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks">the lives of 77 people in Oslo last year</a>.</p>

<p>Breivik has testified that he used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> to train for his attacks. He also testified to be a member of the anti-Muslim militant group Knights Templar and refused to recognise the authority of the federal court system.</p>

<p>The fact that <a href="http://heathenscripture.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/grand-theft-auto-nazareth-jim-wallaces-blame-wars/">videogames play no demonstrable part</a> in Breivik’s (or any other) act of violence hasn’t stopped the media from creating and re-creating this narrative, even to the point that university media officers are picking up the chant.</p>

<h2>The research shows what?</h2>

<p>A University of Gothenburg press release about a new study is entitled <a href="http://www.ufn.gu.se/english/News/newsdetail/researchers-questioning-the-link-between-violent-computer-games-and-aggressiveness-.cid1070001">Researchers questioning link between violent computer games and aggressiveness</a>.</p>

<p>The release reports that the authors are “questioning the whole gaming and violence debate”. The study itself, published in the <a href="http://ijcscl.org/">International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning</a> is entitled <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/d85648r035x12533/">How gamers manage aggression: Situating skills in collaborative computer games</a>.</p>

<p>Taken together, these two titles might lead one to interpret the study in a similar vein to researchers <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/12/5/353.short">Craig Anderson</a> or <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178907000055">Christopher Ferguson</a>. That is, it would make sense to argue either that violent videogames do (Anderson) or do not (Ferguson) have a meaningful effect on players' aggression levels in real life.</p>

<p>Instead, the research is actually a detailed study of how players of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) – such as World of Warcraft – cooperate to manage the attention of powerful, dangerous enemy characters (known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_gaming)">bosses</a>). In MMO parlance, that attention is known as “aggro”.</p>

<p>The aggression being managed, then, is not that of the players, but of the computer-controlled enemies. How, then, is this research linked to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/leicestershire/3934277.stm">debate about media effects</a>?</p>

<p>Hint: it’s not.</p>

<h2>The ‘media effects’ narrative</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/profiles/daniel-golding-2564">Dan Golding</a> pointed out in <a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/gamers-tag-is-a-poor-fit-whichever-way-you-foldit-3519">an earlier article</a> on The Conversation, the media only seem equipped to discuss videogames in three ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>as <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/from-fantasy-to-lethal-reality-breivik-trained-on-modern-warfare-game-20110725-1hw41.html">moral panic</a>
</li>
<li>in terms of (always surprising) <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/germany-video-games-sales-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-299040">economic profit</a> and</li>
<li>as an exotic artefact or <a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/the-subculture-video-games-534483.html">sub-culture</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The press release announcing this new study, as well as coverage of Breivik’s trial by the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/norway-killer-sharpened-aim-with-video-games-20120420-1xas3.html">Sydney Morning Herald</a>, among others, falls right into the first category.</p>

<p>The notion of media effects and transfer (from medium to real-life) is perhaps as old as communications media themselves. Even <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html#470">Plato was wary</a> of the power of the poet “because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason".</p>

<p>Today’s “violence and videogames” narrative is well-worn. So much so that even a public relations officer at a university takes a study on videogames with the word “aggression” in its title to be examining a “link” between mediated depictions of violence and real-world aggression.</p>

<p>But the link to the media effects research such as Anderson and Ferguson’s is not entirely facetious: the Swedish team of researchers are in fact questioning the basis of the videogame violence debate; the “transfer” mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Transfer, as the study points out, is a contentious construct of educational theory. It is, to quote from the article: “the appearance of a person carrying the product of learning from one task, problem, situation, or institution to another”. In this case, the “transfer” of aggression from videogames to real-life.</p>

<p>The authors of this study rightly point out that the nature of transfer is contentious, ill-defined, and rarely agreed upon. Thus, there are <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/136/2/">disagreements</a> about how to empirically measure the effects of media on an audience.</p>

<p>But instead of pursuing this, the paper moves on to conduct a close study of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_(gaming">raid encounters</a> (where numerous players attempt to take out a boss together), documenting the skills and knowledge used by players who cooperate successfully.</p>

<p>These skills include:</p>

<ul>
<li>spatial awareness and the importance of positioning one’s avatar in the immediate geography around the boss before and during the fight</li>
<li>case-specific knowledge about additional enemies entering the fray and appropriate responses</li>
<li>reacting to other unexpected events during the fight, such as the death of a healer (a team member who’s role it is to heal fellow players).</li>
</ul>
<p>The depth and precision of the details presented in this study are valuable and will certainly provide excellent reference material for future scholars who are researching and writing about MMO gameplay. But this study simply isn’t focused on violent videogames leading to aggression in the real world.</p>

<h2>Overcoming the narrative</h2>

<p>The aim of the study I’ve been discussing was, in fact, to take a step back from the debate entirely and avoid assuming the straightforward transfer of media, with regard to videogames.</p>

<p>The authors “approached collaborative gaming where aggression is represented as a practice to be studied on its own premises”.</p>

<p>To that end, the study is working around what media researcher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paul_Gee">James Paul Gee</a> calls “the problem of content". That is, looking past the representations of violence shown on screen and measuring what the human players are actually learning to do while playing the game.</p>

<p>In this case, players deploy very specific knowledge about the geography of terrain, the behaviour of bosses and the various skills their individual avatar possesses.</p>

<p>This study does not suggest that causing an avatar to swing a broadsword will incite the human player to do the same, or similar, the next time he or she steps out of the house for some milk.</p>

<p>Even though there’s no consensus on media effects nor the relationship between videogame and real-world violence, the international press still get completely lost in a frenzy as they pump out hysteria-filled headlines.</p>

<p>Gaming news outlet, <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/04/19/breivik-testifies-about-gaming-press-ignores-the-facts/">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> has called out a range of global outlets on their reporting of the Breivik case. Thankfully, publications such as these are interested in clarity and truth and refuse to allow the popular mythology of videogame violence to cloud basic reporting.</p><p><em>Adam Ruch does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.</em></p><img src="//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/6346/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/conversationedu/~4/T74RKvl9Feg" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

We are told it is good for the environment by cutting waste and needless consumption; we encourage it in our children for their moral growth; we see it used in advertising, and when we think of it as a neighbourhood activity we get a warm and fuzzy glow. But how many people actually go and ask a neighbour for that fabled cup of sugar?</p>

<p>I recently received a “community cake” from a friend. “You’re into sharing with neighbours Millie,” she said, “I’ve got you the perfect present.” I was given a cake tin containing a recipe and all the necessary ingredients for making a cake. All the ingredients except for, you guessed it, a cup of sugar. That is where the community comes in; it was my challenge to go and introduce myself to an unknown neighbour and ask for a cup of sugar.</p>

<p>She gave me the cake because I’m interested in how or if ordinary Australians living in the suburbs share sugar, mix masters, lawn mowers, and other everyday stuff. My PhD explores what it means to share in suburban Australia. My research involves talking to people who are in organised sharing networks as well as those who are not.</p>

<p><figure class="align-left"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9707/width237/gh4tydsx-1334711252.jpg"><figcaption>Some people do not want to share. <span class="source">Flickr/seelensturm</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>References to that ubiquitous cup of sugar are frequent during research conversations.
Many research participants talked nostalgically of the past when a neighbour would think nothing of asking a small favour. Conjuring a time, imagined or otherwise, when people were less lonely, communities more engaged, and consumerism somewhat more restrained. Indeed sharing was seen as a simple solution to the many social and environmental problems facing Australian suburbs.</p>

<p>It is not only my research participants who view sharing with somewhat rose-tinted glasses. Sharing, or what has recently been dubbed as “<a href="http://collaborativeconsumption.com/">collaborative consumption</a>”, is often presented as being a panacea for a plethora of social and environmental ills. A recent Grattan Institute report, <a href="http://www.grattan.edu.au/pub_page/130_social_cities.html">Social Cities</a>, outlines worrying signs about the increase in social isolation and loneliness in Australian cities.</p>

<p>Sharing household resources is listed in the appendix to the report, “ideas for social connection in cities”, as a cost effective way to address declining community connection. Not only viewed as a solution to social problems, sharing, or collaborative consumption, made it into the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2035319_2034098_2034146,00.html">Top Ten Green Stories</a> of 2010 in Time Magazine, in which sharing is considered as “one of the most heartening environmental trends”. <a href="http://www.ozcarpool.com.au/">Carpooling</a> is a classic example where sharing is promoted as being an opportunity to get to know your community and help the environment.</p>

<p>Environmentalist Ted Trainer suggests that “we must share more things” in his paper <a href="http://socialsciences.arts.unsw.edu.au/tsw/">The Simpler Way</a>: An outline of the global situation, the sustainable alternative society, and the transition to it, and his call is supported by environmental groups. The Australian Conservation Foundation and the Alternative Technology Association encourage organised sharing through articles such as ‘<a href="http://www.acfonline.org.au/news-media/news-features/collaborative-consumption-give-little-take-little">Collaborative Consumption: give a little, take a little</a>’  and ‘<a href="http://renew.org.au/recycling/join-the-freecycling-sharehood/">Join the freecycling Sharehood</a>’  in which online sharing networks such as <a href="http://www.thesharehood.org/">The Sharehood</a> and <a href="http://friendswiththings.com.au/">Friends With Things</a> are promoted. These websites facilitate the exchange of goods and services  and aim to build “sustainable and resilient communities”.</p>

<p>The idea of Sharehood has been enthusiastically received by suburban residents with many people signing up as members, yet very few go on to utilise the network. The media has also enthusiastically picked up the concept, yet my research suggests not much actually gets shared. This is interesting given the perception of sharing as the “right thing to do” was common across those involved in the Sharehood, as well as those who were not. And most interesting of all, neither group shared more or less than the other.</p>

<p>So why are local neighbourhood sharing networks failing?  With so many people willing to share items, generously posting offers to fix computers, lend wheelbarrows, and teach singing, what could possibly be going wrong?</p>

<p>The problem is in our definition of sharing. In practice, sharing is considered to be an act of generosity, rather than the common use or ownership of goods, time, or experience. We are taught as children that sharing is about being generous. Recently Play School changed the story of the Little Red Hen. In the original the little red hen asks the farm animals to help make her bread. They all refuse to help but want to share in the eating and the little red hen refuses. In the new version, the hen agrees to share her bread. When I asked Play School their reasons for changing the story they emailed back, saying:</p>

<p><em>We felt it was more in keeping with the ideas of generosity and sharing (which the program frequently models), in hand with a commitment to share in the work next time …</em></p>

<p>So sharing is promoted as being generous and, as it turns out while we’re really good at offering things and favours, we’re terrible at receiving. Research participants highlight this: “I’ll be damned if I’d ask”, “I wouldn’t want to impose” and, “I’ve got everything I already need” were common in discussions of sharing.</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9718/width668/xsd7ywqw-1334716401.jpg"><figcaption>We need to learn to receive. <span class="source">Flickr/Melissa Wall</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Although there are examples where sharing between neighbours is successful, both within my study and in the studies of others, it seems that this is the exception rather than the rule.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for programs aiming to encourage sharing?</p>

<p>Firstly, we cannot underestimate the cultural power of our need to be self-sufficient and to remain obligation free. As Robert Menzies proclaimed in his 1942 speech, <a href="http://www.liberals.net/theforgottenpeople.htm">The Forgotten People</a>:</p>

<p><em>My home is where my wife and children are … the instinct to give them a chance in life – to make them not leaners but lifters – is a noble instinct.</em></p>

<p>For some, the request for a cup of sugar, a ladder, or advice about pumpkins, is an acknowledgement of an inability to cope on one’s own.  No one wants to be seen as needy or not pulling their weight.</p>

<p>Giving is promoted as being ideologically and morally sound. We are constantly being reminded to give more and take less, yet perhaps we forget that to receive can be an act of giving. As one research participant said: “to learn to receive with an open heart may be one of the most difficult things”, yet I believe it may also be one of the most effective methods of community development.</p>

<p>The second thing to remember in our quest to increase neighbourly sharing is the value placed on privacy. With increasingly busy lives the desire to maintain the home as a private space is integral to the maintenance of the great Australian Dream. In many research conversations, people noted the paradox in their desire to be more neighbourly and engaged, yet at the same time wanting to avoid being drawn in to local networks of obligation. To ask a neighbour for something today, means tomorrow – perhaps at your inconvenience – the obligation must be repaid.</p>

<p>In mustering my courage to seek a cup of sugar for my community cake, I must, according to Menzies, become a “leaner”. Yet, what my study seems to show is that rather than being a burden, the very act of asking a neighbour for assistance is a generous act as it opens up the social landscape of acceptable community behaviour.</p>

<p>Neighbours get your cups ready!</p>

Delivered in partnership with the Australian government.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Today, Professor David Walker looks to the past to help understand what we mean by “the Asian Century.”</strong></p>

<p>In introducing the <a href="http://asiancentury.dpmc.gov.au/">Henry inquiry</a> into Australia’s place in the Asian Century, prime minister Julia Gillard twice used the phrase, “We have not been here before”. There is some truth in this observation, but it also captures a particularly Australian response to the history of Asian engagement.</p>

<p>While the understandable focus of the Henry inquiry is Australia’s place in the Asian Century and the shift of economic, political and cultural power to the region, there is a strong case to be made for putting this inquiry in a broader historical context.</p>

<p>One of the repeated motifs of our history is that the Asia we face is always new and quite unprecedented. The past, according to this view, offers no guide to the future and tells us nothing worth knowing. No sophisticated society would take such a dismissive view of its own history. The nations we seek to engage with in the region certainly do not.</p>

<h2>Australia’s Asian past</h2>

<p>There has been a sustained commentary on the implications of Australia’s proximity to Asia from the late nineteenth century since Federation when many of our understandings of the kind of society we wanted to create were laid down.</p>

<p>While this is not always a comforting story, it does us more credit in the region to be open rather than evasive about our history. When it comes to weighing the past, no-one’s hands are entirely clean.</p>

<p>The first invasion novel (starring the Chinese as invaders) was the sensitively titled “White or Yellow: a Story of the Race War of AD 1908” by <a href="White%20or%20Yellow:%20a%20Story%20of%20the%20Race%20War%20of%20AD%201908">William Lane</a>. It was serialised in 1888.</p>

<p>On a more positive note, the first systematic case for the teaching of Asian languages in Australian universities dates from 1908.</p>

<p>The fascinating and often surprising history of Asian “engagement” is not well-known and still has only a minor place in the teaching of Australian history at secondary and tertiary level.</p>

<p>It is all very well to seek a fuller understanding of Asia, but that should be accompanied by a closer knowledge of how Australians have understood and responded to Asia. How can we hope to know “Asia” without knowing ourselves?</p>

<p>Such an exercise would help clarify the disconnections between what we have variously imagined “Asia” to be up to, its alleged schemes, plots and ambitions and what we can learn from the history of the region. Our imaginings and their histories do not necessarily coincide.</p>

<h2>Reaching for hyperbole</h2>

<p>A further reason for knowing the history is that it can expose and help avoid unhelpful stereotypes. The notion of “unprecedented Asia” is a case in point. The belief that the new Asia is unprecedented, something outside of our history, reinforces rather than diminishes anxieties about Australia’s vulnerability to Asia.</p>

<p>It suggests overwhelming forces and inundating floods that destroy whole communities. We need to know how such Orientalist constructions of Asia entered our language and thinking in order to avoid them and to see more clearly the real opportunities and threats arising from our regional location.</p>

<p>One of the defining characteristics of a robust democracy is the willingness to expose both the decisions of the past and their underlying rationale to historical scrutiny. One of the dangers we face in thinking of the new Asia as unprecedented is to be trapped in the past, rather than informed by it.</p>

<p>In concrete terms, the Australian response to its impending Asian future has tended over the previous century to oscillate between extremes: alarmist anxiety at the prospect of our society being swallowed up by advancing Asia or, at the other extreme, dreams of new rivers of gold. When it comes to Asia we reach for hyperbole.</p>

<h2>Seeing ourselves in Asia</h2>

<p>Our task is to understand the kind of society we want to create over the next 50 years. While international factors will influence our future, they need not determine it.</p>

<p>There is also much to be gained by recognising that behind the great abstractions – Asia, the Asian Century, Asia-literacy – are the people-to-people contacts that provide the strongest foundation for knowing Asia. Though they may be harder to itemise and tabulate, these human contacts will provide rewards as enduring as any we are likely to derive from the export of iron ore.</p>

<p>I should add that I welcome the Henry inquiry, so much so that I believe a good case can be made for having a regular audit of our thinking about Australia’s place in the region.</p>

<p>Had there been enquiries of this kind every ten years from 1972, Ken Henry would have the benefit of four previous inquiries examining responses to Australia’s place in the region.</p>

<p>Considered reflection of this kind would certainly deepen and extend our understanding of what “engagement” means, how that has been understood, and – to varying degrees – welcomed or resisted.</p>

<p>And we must remember that one of the first things we see in looking to Asia are the hopes, fears and preoccupations of our own society.</p>

<p>They’re thanking you for the free advertising supplied by this article, and around 7,500 like it, reporting on Air Aroma’s replication of the fragrance of an Apple MacBook Pro for <a href="http://westspace.org.au/calendar/event/de-facto-standard/">an exhibition</a> by Melbourne artists Greatest Hits, opening today.</p>

<p>The artists <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/18/scent_of_new_macbook/">sent a new MacBook Pro to Air Aroma</a> who went to work creating a fragrance reminiscent of plastics, paint, paper and aluminium.</p>

<h2>The sweet smell of earned media</h2>

<p>At its core, the story represents the sweet smell of a highly successful viral <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/interactive_marketing/2009/12/defining-earned-owned-and-paid-media.html">earned media</a> campaign, in which free media attention is drawn to a promotional stunt (as opposed to paying for advertising).</p>

<p>It combines the built-in fanboy/girl audience for an Apple story – <em>any</em> Apple story – with the potential for a more general audience because it’s also a feel-good story about technology and art: we can all chuckle at those kooky modern artists.</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9794/width668/k2frd83s-1334881984.jpg"><figcaption><span class="source">hochit</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p><a href="http://www.air-aroma.com/blog/the-scent-of-a-apple-product-sourcing-the-macbook-pro-fragrance">Air Aroma’s blog post explaining the stunt</a> was all the Apple blogs needed to send the story viral in social media, after which it was noticed by the mainstream media. Greatest Hits, the West Space gallery and Air Aroma scored direct attention, and Apple scored indirect attention. That being said, why should this particular smell garner such attention?</p>

<p><a href="http://westspace.org.au/calendar/event/de-facto-standard/">Greatest Hits' De Facto Standard exhibition</a> is an artistic statement about technology and consumer culture. The smell of a just-opened MacBook Pro represents an interesting de facto standard.</p>

<p>Many Apple products are de facto standards in their class – think iPads, iPhones and iPods – but <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/pages/steve-jobs">Steve Jobs</a> was famous for demanding that the design for both products and packaging be beautiful and iconic. Not just de facto standard, then, but also the gold standard.</p>

<p>The combination of the famous cultishness of Apple users with this notion of gold standard iconic design at all levels has led Apple products to be among the most popular for the uniquely geeky practice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unboxing">“unboxing”</a>.</p>

<h2>Unboxing porn: self-perpetuating earned media</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/unboxing-the-new-geek-porn-1333955.html">Unboxing is geek porn</a>. Video or picture sets are taken of a packaging striptease, from a sealed box, through each petticoat of plastic and garter of twist-tie, to the virginal-yet-nubile gadget itself. For an outsider, it’s an excruciatingly slow process.</p>

<p>For geeks, it’s a study of form meeting function. Videos on sites such as <a href="http://unboxing.gearlive.com/">unboxing.com</a> are typically three minutes long, but can be a long as half an hour, as was the case for a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;v=xaOyJ5FUjSw">10-year-old, sealed 20th anniversary Mac</a>.</p>

<p><figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/31XS1WrC5_0?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Unboxing a MacBook Pro 15'‘. Parental supervision is advised.</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>These videos are a particularly potent form of earned media, because they are self-perpetuating. As long as a company continues to produce interesting devices in interesting packaging, the videos reinforce attention to the company.</p>

<p>Further, since the unboxing phenomenon is not limited to the products of one company, companies that aim to compete for iconic status must produce packaging worthy of the fetish. But even failures reinforce the general sense of excitement of the unboxing ritual, the particular brand and brand competition.</p>

<p><figure class="align-right zoomable"><a href="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9788/area14mp/rncgz5pv-1334879409.jpg"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9788/width237/rncgz5pv-1334879409.jpg"></a>

<p>Unboxing is not limited to gadgets. Software, new books (especially those in series such as Harry Potter and Twilight) or really any consumer good can become an item of worship with an accompanying revelatory event.</p>

<p>And, of course, media outlets will report on such events if they are large, widespread, or, as in this case, kooky.</p>

<p>The “new Mac” smell is prized among Apple users, and especially unboxing afficionados. It is common to all unboxings and it clearly has cultural links to the “new car” smell that gets many people’s motors' racing. As such, the “Eau de MacBook” episode is a textbook case of leveraging the base desires of Apple fans to create media attention.</p>

<p>Of the groups involved, only Apple could afford to pay for such attention, but it doesn’t have to – it just needs to keep bringing sexy back.</p>

And have you ever wondered what actually happens to your muscles when you exercise?</p>

<p>Recent studies have begun to look, in detail, at the changes that occur in the way our genes are used both during and after exercise. And the results of <a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1550413112000058/1-s2.0-S1550413112000058-main.pdf?_tid=74b89047b22dac5ef7c70791ba47fcd2&amp;acdnat=1334713932_98c59e8b5dee44cf363ec5d84965b8bf">the most recent study</a>, by <a href="http://metabol.ku.dk/researchers/zierath/">Dr Juleen Zierath</a> and colleagues, might hold insights into why our fitness trails off after stopping exercise.</p>

<p>But first, a bit of background.</p>

<p>Of the tens of thousands of genes you have in each and every cell of your body, only a subset are used at any one time in each cell. If a gene is used, the information within is used to create a protein product; a process called <a href="http://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-Gene-Expression.aspx">gene expression</a>.</p>

<p>The genes that are used (the gene expression, in other words) then determines the function of the cell in question. A different set of genes being expressed will produce a cell that fulfils a different purpose.</p>

<p>For instance, red blood cells express the haemoglobin gene and so make haemoglobin, which can bind oxygen, and allows these cells to traffic oxygen around the body. Other blood cells that fight infection, the white blood cells, produce toxic chemicals and enzymes to attack the invading infection.</p>

<p><figure class="align-right"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9759/width237/k7shzgxq-1334799428.jpg"><figcaption><span class="source">BreadnBadger</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Over the last few years, <a href="http://sport1.uibk.ac.at/lehre/burtscher/Coffey2007.pdf">it has been shown</a> that exercise rapidly induces changes in gene expression in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_striated_muscle">skeletal muscle cells</a>.</p>

<p>These are cells that you voluntarily contract when you exercise – such as your thigh muscles – rather than say the heart muscle, which contracts without you thinking about it, even when you’re asleep.</p>

<p>Most of the changes in genes induced by exercise are related to the usage of energy within the skeletal muscle cell. Interestingly, these changes are proportional to how hard you train: higher intensity exercise leads to more dramatic changes in the skeletal muscle cells.</p>

<p>This makes sense: the harder you train, the more energy is required by your muscles. The changes in the energy-usage genes are also maintained long after you’ve finished your workout.</p>

<p>This helps to explain why your metabolic rate – the amount of energy you burn – is high during the workout and for several hours afterwards.</p>

<p>So how does a skeletal muscle cell bring about the quick changes in the genes that are used, to rapidly provide the energy required for exercise? And how do they allow the energy-usage genes to be switched on?</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://sport1.uibk.ac.at/lehre/burtscher/Coffey2007.pdf">we know calcium is released within the cell</a>, sending a signal to alter gene expression. But then how does the calcium signal alter which genes are expressed?</p>

<p><figure><iframe width="440" height="253" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LVoaaD73VB8?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure></p>

<p>The recent study by Dr Zierath and colleagues, published in the <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/704292/description#description">Cell Metabolism journal</a>, has started to address this question.</p>

<p>They looked at small modifications made to the genes in skeletal muscle cells, called <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/think-you-can-think-yourself-better-think-again-558">epigenetic marks</a>.</p>

<p>Epigenetic marks are tags associated with your genes that help a cell interpret when to use a gene and when to switch a gene off.</p>

<p>One way to think of epigenetic marks is as the punctuation marks in the cell. Punctuation marks don’t change the words themselves, they just help us to read a sentence. The same is true of epigenetic marks: they don’t change the genetic information, they just help the cell to <em>make sense</em> of that genetic information.</p>

<p>Dr Zierath’s group found that exercise induces skeletal muscle cells to switch on the energy-usage genes while removing some epigenetic marks from the energy-usage genes.</p>

<p>Like the changes in the gene expression itself, these changes in epigenetic marks are rapidly induced and are maintained for several hours after the exercise session.</p>

<p>But the epigenetic changes are not retained for even a couple of days after a three-week training program – the length of time the study’s subjects were asked to train for.</p>

<p>Most athletes know that <a href="http://www.joefrielsblog.com/2011/04/never-miss-a-workout.html">peak fitness is only retained for a day or so</a> after completing a training program. Could the work of Zierath and colleagues explain why?</p>

<p>That is, does fitness wear off because the epigenetic marks on energy-usage genes within skeletal muscle cells have returned to normal?</p>

<p><figure><iframe width="440" height="253" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9AfBsTAQ8zs?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure></p>

<p>Perhaps even more interesting is a small part of Dr Zierath’s study which showed that some of the changes in gene expression and epigenetic marks on energy-usage genes can be mimicked by caffeine.</p>

<p>Your daily coffee could be giving your genes a workout!</p>

<p>It’s been <a href="http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/5/4/868.short">known for some time</a> that many of the gene expression changes induced by exercise can also be influenced by signals from the brain or hormones in your blood stream. But in the case of caffeine, we are clearly much more able to manipulate the system to our advantage.</p>

<p>There is still much to be learnt about caffeine-induced changes in gene expression, and how it compares to actually working up a sweat at the gym.</p>

<p>Many intriguing questions remain, not least of which: does caffeine exposure alter the effectiveness of your training?</p>

<p>No-one would recommend a coffee rather than exercise but maybe a coffee before your workout could actually enhance your body’s physiological response to exercise … even if the coffee does leave you dehydrated and jittery.</p>

<p>This is certainly something worth testing. On the flip side, these effects may add weight to recent <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-07-08/doping-body-to-consider-caffeine-ban/896332">calls for caffeine bans</a> to be reintroduced to competitive sports.</p>

<p>The official response to these images has been to declare  them <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gGHTRRfXwaGEHZsYyj-I0XhpiTbw?docId=CNG.0757215e5593a502e308acf19427216b.21">an aberration</a>, the product of an unrepresentative group. It has also been implied that the press is irresponsible for circulating them, even if in this case only a selection has been made public.</p>

<p>But rather than an aberration, these images may offer an insight into the changing nature of war and violence.</p>

<h2>A growing trend</h2>

<p>Earlier this year video circulated of a group of American troops <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/us-marines-urination-video-an-artefact-of-war-says-expert-4925">urinating on the dead bodies</a> of alleged Taliban fighters.</p>

<p>In 2004, hundreds of images of torture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse">emerged</a> from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.</p>

<p>In 2005, it <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/09/28/web.photos/">emerged</a> that troops in Iraq and Afghanistan were uploading images of dead and mutilated bodies in Iraq and Afghanistan in exchange for access to pornographic websites.</p>

<p>Many of these images spilled into the public domain and remain there today. Just enter “cooked Iraqi” into a search engine and you will see a group of smiling marines surrounding the incinerated body of an Iraqi. This image was originally uploaded in exchange for access to pornography.</p>

<h2>Digital warfare</h2>

<p>There is continuity and transformation at work here. In the Pacific theatre during World War II, it was not unusual for the body parts of Japanese soldiers to be taken as souvenirs. One well-known example is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LIFE_May_1944_Jap_Skull.jpg">photo published</a> in Life Magazine in 1944 of an American woman with the skull of a Japanese soldier she had received from her navy fiancée. This photo featured as “picture of the week”.</p>

<p>But as we have entered the digital age, some sort of transformation has taken place. It is no longer journalists taking the photos, but military personnel themselves.</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9774/width668/q6rs6shp-1334813753.jpg"><figcaption>The latest photos are in the same tradition as the Abu Ghraib images that shocked the world. <span class="source">DSK</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The Abu Ghraib pictures were originally taken for circulation among friends and military colleagues, many modelled on the pornographic images that were being widely consumed by guards at the prison.</p>

<p>Others were modelled on the stereotypical poses that tourists adopt when visiting markets or standing in front of monuments – smiling for the camera, making sure that the site being visited is in the background.</p>

<p>A visual grammar recurs throughout these images, one where guards pose making a “thumbs up” gesture to the camera, whether squatting next to a corpse or in front of hooded prisoners being forced to masturbate.</p>

<p>This same grammar is evident in the hundreds of photos traded for access to pornography in 2005, and it recurs again in the photos that surfaced this week.</p>

<p>The entry of digital cameras into warzones both records a transformation at work, and is also an instrument of that transformation.</p>

<h2>Shifting battlefields</h2>

<p>The classical sociological theories of warfare emphasise a modern military model, one of uniforms, ranks, obedience and a culture of honour.</p>

<p>This is the model that emerged from the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Final_Act_of_the_Congress_of_Vienna">Vienna accords</a> of 1815, where war was to become the domain of specialist professional armies, separated from day-to-day life, where soldiers opposed in war would be united in a shared culture of valour.</p>

<p>This is captured in World War I, where war took place in isolated fields, where estimates suggest the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_casualties">vast majority</a> of those killed were military personnel.</p>

<p>Most of us are aware that today’s wars are radically different. The most obvious indicator is that most of those who die in war today are civilians, with war taking place in cities and suburbs, not isolated fieldd. They are prosecuted not only by professional armies but by militias, clans, organised crime, corporations, friends and even individuals.</p>

<h2>Personalising conflict</h2>

<p>These images alert us to another dimension of this transformation. In the classical military model, violence is de-individualised in a military culture of obedience. The increasing presence of digital cameras in war zones alerts us to a reversal of this pattern, underlining the increasing role of private experience in war.</p>

<p>Today, the violence of war is increasingly personalised. That is why we are seeing this blurring of public duty and private pleasure captured by the entry of stereotypical tourist practices into war-zones.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that at Abu Ghraib most of the indicators of classical military culture had broken down: uniforms were not worn, practices such as saluting were abandoned, people of different ranks were sleeping together.</p>

<p>Significantly, the soldier who forwarded these most recent images to the Los Angeles Times is believed to have done so because of concern about a collapse of discipline.</p>

<p>In the classical model of war, violence is contained: spatially, in the battlefield, and psychologically, through military discipline that separates person and function. Today this separation is less and less viable.</p>

<h2>Collapsing culture</h2>

<p>The images published by the Los Angeles Times are not an aberration.</p>

<p>They point to one of the most significant transformations at work in contemporary warfare. Violence has been de-personalised, and this is linked to what amounts to a demilitarisation of the armed forces and the collapse of the culture of honour, in particular as it is extended to the enemy.</p>

<p>Next week we celebrate ANZAC day, a day that is fast becoming our national day. Whatever the merits of this development, it runs a great risk of sentimentality and looking backwards to a time when violence was contained, by professional armies and by a culture that extends honour to the enemy.</p>

<p>Today’s wars are radically different. These photos remind us of that.</p><p><em>Kevin McDonald is a sociologist and Director of the Centre for Cultural Diversity and Wellbeing at Victoria University.

<p>Typically, drinks such as Red Bull, Monster, Mother and <a href="http://www.news.com.au/national/cocaine-energy-drink-launched-in-australia/story-e6frfkvr-1225720672285">Cocaine</a> contain a cocktail of caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone and sugar. And they are heavily promoted to shift workers, students and long-haul drivers.</p>

<h2>Local standards</h2>

<p>An estimated $15 million was spent in 2009 alone on marketing by the energy drinks industry in Australia. It’s obviously money well spent; energy drink sales <a href="http://au.nielsen.com/site/documents/ConvenienceReport2008-extob.pdf">account for one in five beverages sold by convenience stores</a>.</p>

<p>The caffeine content of a can of Red Bull – 80 milligrams for a 250 millilitre can – is roughly the same as a standard cup of coffee. But such <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2012/196/1/energy-drinks-health-risks-and-toxicity#">potent energy drinks</a> have recently caused <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/3/511.full.html">concern</a> in the health profession.</p>

<p>In Australia and New Zealand, energy drink manufacturers are required to print a health warning on all cans stating: “This food contains caffeine and is not recommended for children, pregnant or lactating women and individuals sensitive to caffeine”. They are also expected to advise consumers to limit intake to a maximum of two cans in one day.</p>

<h2>Health risks</h2>

<p>There’s growing international concern about the likely negative health effects of energy drinks. A growing body of research evidence directly links energy drink consumption to cardiovascular risk and other adverse health outcomes.</p>

<p><figure class="align-right"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9661/width237/3tmdzmft-1334559998.jpg"><figcaption><span class="source">camknows/flickr</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Available since 1987, Red Bull was the first energy drink on the market and sales reached <a href="http://www.redbull.com/cs/Satellite/en_INT/company-figures/001242939605518?pcs_c=PCS_Product&amp;pcs_cid=1242937556133">4.6 billion cans worldwide in 2011</a>.</p>

<p>Its original formula was banned in France in 1996 on the basis of the unknown health consequences of taurine, and only a modified version was allowed. But the ban was lifted by the European Commission following a 2008 French Food Safety investigation that was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/07/15/us-france-redbull-idUSL1576964720080715">unable to prove the existence of health risks.</a></p>

<p>European regulations require positive proof of harm and a growing body of research evidence may soon be able to assist.</p>

<p><strong>Research findings</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1475-2891-6-35.pdf">2007 study</a> of students found they were using energy drinks to cope with their lack of sleep and for mixing with alcohol. Researchers found they consumed energy drinks between one and four days in a month. The study also showed young adults had three or more such drinks with alcohol when partying.</p>

<p>The “Jagerbomb”, for instance, is a popular way to combine alcohol and energy drinks. It comprises of a measure of the alcohol Jagermeister dropped into a glass of Red Bull, which is then consumed as a shot. The drink delivers an alcohol, sugar and caffeine fix and can be consumed with high frequency.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jabfm.org/content/23/4/555.abstract">Research from 2010</a> suggests that adding alcohol to energy drinks leads to an increased rate of absorption through the carbonation and dilution of the alcohol. This allows the drinker to stay awake for longer and consume an even greater amount of alcohol through binge drinking. It also lessens the appearance of drunkenness but not its effects.</p>

<p>Two city councils in New South Wales – Manly and <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/shots-of-alcohol-banned/story-e6frf00i-1111113510642">Newcastle</a> – have banned pubs and clubs from selling Jagerbombs on the basis that they encourage irresponsible and binge drinking. Some “schoolies week” events have also adopted this safety initiative or taken some other approach to limit their sale.</p>

<p><figure class="align-left"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9757/width237/tnkw7nzq-1334797835.jpg"><figcaption><span class="source">Taryn</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01352.x/abstract">Research from 2011</a> involving a group of fourth-year university students found weekly or daily energy drink consumption was strongly associated with alcohol dependence. Although this study had a small sample, it makes a good case for targeting alcohol dependence prevention education at this group.</p>

<p>Consuming energy drinks has also been associated with a number of other health complications including irritability, headache, nervousness, insomnia, hallucinations, <a href="http://emj.bmj.com/content/28/8/712">seizure</a>, <a href="http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/5/1/18">irregular</a> or <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1752-1947-5-18.pdf">rapid heartbeat</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20103032">heart attacks</a> and <a href="http://www.pharmacytoday.org/pdf/2008/May_CE_exam.pdf">death</a>.</p>

<p>But it’s not all doom and gloom. Energy drinks have a positive impact on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11665810">physical performance</a> in sport and increased cognitive function, including choice reaction time, concentration and memory. A study that was financially supported by Red Bull found all this may be particularly helpful when <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21063868">driving prolonged distances</a> or cramming for exams.</p>

<p><strong>A public heath issue</strong></p>

<p>Mass consumption of energy drinks is fast becoming a public health issue. <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2012/196/1/energy-drinks-health-risks-and-toxicity#1">Research</a> looking at the number of calls to the Australian Poisons Information Centre recorded a 400% increase in annually reported incidents between 2004 and 2010. It found a total of 297 reports about energy drinks recorded over the seven years, noting the number only included cases the centre was alerted to.</p>

<p>Governments should consider measures to curb the potential harm of energy drinks. These could include clearer labelling similar to those on over-the-counter caffeine tablets; restricting the sale of energy drinks based on age; and re-classing such beverages as non-prescription medications.</p>

<p>Coupled with targeted community education, such action may help keep people of all age groups, but especially teenagers, safe from the hazards of binging on energy drinks.</p><p><em>Patricia Davidson receives funding from ARC and NHMRC</em></p>

These strategies rest on the assumption once someone has taken a “simple and painless” action – say, turning off their lights for an hour – it can spill over into more ambitious environmental behaviours. Such a belief essentially provides the foundation for campaigns that focus on “taking a few simple steps” or claiming that “every little bit counts”.</p>

<p>But critics of these campaigns argue that “if everyone does a little, we’ll achieve only a little”, especially in the face of today’s environmental challenges.</p>

<p>We believe that campaigns calling for simple behaviours with relatively small environmental benefit should only persist if there is evidence showing that they lead to more far-reaching and environmentally significant behaviours. But current evidence suggests that both positive and negative spillover effects arise from the initial performance of small and easy actions.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons that taking a simple, easy step might lead to more positive results. Some individuals get skills and knowledge from taking that first step. Some alter their self-perceptions, starting to see themselves as “concerned citizens”. Some want to be seen as acting consistently with their previous actions. The marketing equivalent is often referred to as the “foot-in-the-door” approach.</p>

<p>But things can also go the other way. Some people “rest on their laurels”. Taking small and easy steps can lead to individuals thinking they have “done their bit” for the environment. They justify their decision to take no further (and potentially far more important) action.</p>

<p>With evidence supporting both positive and negative spillover effects, programs that continue to target simple and painless actions gamble that positive spillover outcomes will be victorious. But how can we “increase the odds” of further positive action? Are certain behaviours or motivations more likely than others to encourage people on a journey of pro-environmental behavioural escalation?</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/pb13574-behaviours-report-080110.pdf">report</a> asking this very question, the UK’s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs concluded that “We need to promote a range of behaviours as entry points in helping different groups to make their lifestyles more sustainable – including catalytic (or ‘wedge’) behaviours if identified through research.”</p>

<p>While we are some way off identifying catalytic behaviours and countering negative spillover, research is starting to reveal the importance of behaviours sharing certain characteristics to foster positive spillover effects. People are likely to see behaviours as similar when:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>there are common characteristics between the behaviours: the skills required to do them, the level of difficulty, similarity between the behaviours themselves or the context in which they are undertaken</p></li>
<li><p>there are common motivations or goals: saving the environment, saving money or being seen as a good citizen.
Many Australians are familiar with a situation where they were called on to be good citizens: widespread public, media and Government concern about decreasing water supplies in several cities led to significant reductions in water use.  These reductions came through multiple behaviours with the common goal of saving water. We suggest that this common motivation may be key.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If this is true, it raises questions for campaigns that rely on one motivation to achieve behavioural changes and then hope that positive spillover will occur in other areas. For example, the Federal Government’s Clean Energy Future program focuses strongly on the financial rewards of the scheme. In the rolling sequence of headline stories at the <a href="http://www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au/">top of the webpage</a>, two of the four stories highlight financial benefits. Just below these rolling headings there is a calculator for estimating the financial assistance individuals are entitled to. It says, “HOW MUCH WILL I GET?”.</p>

<p>Behaviours that are <em>externally</em> motivated by the prospect of financial rewards and savings may work as catalysts for other behaviours that result in saving money or financial benefits. But they are unlikely to generate the <em>internal</em> motivation often required of positive spillover strategies focusing on the environment. The behaviours and motivations are too different.</p>

<p>There are many initiatives that emphasise, and in our opinion over-emphasise, the cost savings of reduced water, energy and waste, rather than environmental benefits.</p>

<p>Of course, it is naïve to think that appeals to environmental consciousness alone will result in the necessary changes. But if an environmental behaviour change campaign wants spillover – and many clearly do – then they need to set up campaigns where people take small, easy steps because they are <em>concerned about the environment</em>. If campaigns are all about saving money or other motivations, it is possible – indeed likely – that first simple step will also be the last.</p>

Delivered in partnership with the Australian government.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Today, Professor Jeff Borland suggests how Australia can re-skill its workforce, and busts some myths on immigration and jobs.</strong></p>

<p>Many economic commentators with an interest in labour markets seem bedevilled by a bogeyman: the rise of Asia.</p>

<p>Whatever the problem that has arisen in labour markets in Australia in the past 20 years, the effect of increasing integration with Asia has usually been the explanation that is reached for first.</p>

<p>Declining real earnings for low-skilled workers?  Well, that must be the effect of more imports produced using low-wage labour in China.</p>

<p>Higher rates of unemployment? Mmm, that could only be happening because of higher rates of Asian immigration.</p>

<p>Falling employment of clerical workers and middle managers?  Surely that has to be the result of off-shoring jobs to the Indian IT sector.</p>

<h2>Where’s the evidence?</h2>

<p>In some ways, this focus on Asia is understandable. Signs of our closer integration with Asia are all around us – in the changing composition of the Australian population, in all the talk of a mining boom, every time we buy a whitegood. Yet for all the concern, there is very little evidence that integration with Asia is having the dire effects often described.</p>

<p>Studies of international trade undertaken by the <a href="http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/staff/jib/documents/EarningsInequality.pdf">Reserve Bank and Productivity Commission</a> have found little effect of import substitution on aggregate employment in Australia. Only within a subset of sectors that use labour-intensive production methods – such as textiles, clothing and footwear – can relatively large adverse employment effects of growing competition from imports be seen.</p>

<h2>Immigrants don’t take jobs</h2>

<p>The story with immigration has been similar. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8462.00087/abstract">Raja Junankar and Glenn Withers</a> showed in a series of research papers written in the 1990s that immigration has little net effect on the labour market in Australia. An extra immigrant may mean an extra job is needed, but it also means an extra source of demand for goods and services produced in Australia. So, the effects on labour demand and labour supply largely wash out.</p>

<p>And while stores of call-centre and IT processing jobs being sent offshore to Asia may make interesting reading for the supplement sections of our weekend newspapers, it just doesn’t seem that the magnitude of these events are substantial enough to make a big difference to labour markets. Instead, it is technological change that appears to be the main driver of the decline in clerical and some administrative jobs.</p>

<h2>First principles</h2>

<p>The story of Australia’s increasing integration with Asia, in fact, seems to be very much as you would predict from a knowledge of first-year economics.</p>

<p>Growing international trade and migration will change the structure of economic activity in Australia. We will specialise more in production activities in which we have a comparative advantage, and buy the goods and services that we are less efficient at producing from overseas. This means  there will be winners and losers in the Australian labour market.</p>

<p>At the moment, for example, it is a good time to be a mining engineer or construction worker, but not such a good time to be a manufacturing worker. Overall, however, we should expect the gains from closer integration to outweigh the losses.</p>

<p>Our economy and labour market will perform more strongly for the opportunity to focus on the activities that Australia is best suited to, an effect that will be magnified by our proximity to Asia.</p>

<h2>Skills, skills, skills</h2>

<p>The big question, I think, is what the Australian labour market can do to take most advantage of the opportunity that the Asian century presents. This is not a new question, and I don’t believe  the answer is rocket science. But the question and answer are important and, for that reason, worth taking up again.</p>

<p>Our first strategy should be “skills, skills, skills”.  Australia’s comparative advantage relative to Asia is in production activities that are intensive in high-skilled labour, so we need a foundation for continued specialisation in those areas.</p>

<p>This will require us to “run to stay ahead”, as Asian nations also seek to increase the skill levels of their workforces, with a <a href="http://www.grattan.edu.au/pub_page/129_report_learning_from_the_best.html">recent Grattan Institute report</a> suggesting rapid improvement in numeracy and literacy skill levels in Hong Kong, China and Singapore.</p>

<p>Maintaining Australia’s position as a high-skilled country is largely about increasing participation in higher education, but it is also about improving the quality of education – particularly through programs with demonstrated net benefits, such as early intervention programs to assist children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

<p>It can also be about giving new opportunities to students from Asia. With the size of population in Asia, and the higher education systems there still having some way to go to allow the same rates of participation as in Australia, it seems there is scope to attract high-quality students from Asia who are not able to gain access to university study in their own countries.</p>

<p>A large-scale scholarship system targeted at students from Asia for graduate level study in science and engineering fields would be one idea for adding to the skilled workforce in both Australia and the students’ home countries.</p>

<h2>Flexibility</h2>

<p>The second strategy I would suggest is to foster flexibility and facilitate adjustment. In the Asian century, it seems that it will be increasingly important that Australian workers can be flexible in the locations where they work, and with whom they work.</p>

<p>More particularly, closer integration is likely to mean a higher chance of spending time working in Asia and working with Asian co-workers. Having this flexibility would seem to require some proportion of the Australian workforce to have Asian language skills but, probably more importantly, an awareness of Asian cultures, as well as a culture in Australia that values diversity in the workplace.</p>

<p>I have described how closer integration with Asia will be the source of adjustment in the labour market – for example, of some job losses. Easing adjustment to these sorts of changes is not something we have done well in Australia in the past.</p>

<p>Yet it could be a powerful mechanism for generating acceptance of change. Certainly, we have a system of welfare income support benefits to provide a safety net for those who lose their jobs as the Australian economy adjusts to changes in patterns of international trade.</p>

<p>We could, however, do much more to assist those who are disadvantaged by structural change in the economy to get back into work – through serious programs for re-skilling and providing pathways to re-employment.</p>

But there is one group in Australia who has not shared in our rising national prosperity at all: people receiving unemployment payments (<a href="http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/payments/newstart.htm">Newstart Allowance</a>).</p>

<p>People reliant on pensions and benefits are recognised as being amongst the poorest in our community. Age and disability pensioners have always received higher payment rates than the unemployed. But since 1997, when the Howard government started to index pensions to average weekly earnings but continued to index unemployment payments to the consumer price index, the gap has widened significantly.</p>

<p>Following the recommendations of <a href="http://www.fahcsia.gov.au/about/publicationsarticles/corp/BudgetPAES/budget09_10/pension/Documents/Pension_Review_Report/part3.htm">the Harmer Review</a>, in September 2009 the federal government increased the single rate of Age Pension by more than $35 per week – one of the largest pension increases in Australian history.</p>

<p>This was a welcome change that significantly reduced income poverty among the aged.  However, this further widened the gap between Newstart and pensions to the point where the shortfall is now nearly $266 per fortnight. In 1997, a single unemployed person received 92% of what was paid to a pensioner; that ratio is now 65%.</p>

<p>It is not just that the unemployed are falling behind other social security recipients. They are falling behind every other group in the community on virtually any comparable measure.</p>

<p>Since 1996, payments for the single unemployed have fallen from 23.5% of the average wage for males to 19.5%. Furthermore, the level of Newstart for a single person has fallen from around 54% to 45% of the after-tax minimum wage. Newstart has fallen from 46% of median family income in 1996 to 36% in 2009-10 – or, from a little way below a standard relative income poverty line, to a long way below.</p>

<p>In 1996, a single unemployed person would have received an income that was about $14 a week (in 2010 values) less than a person in the 10th percentile of the overall income distribution.  In 2009-10, they would have been $116 a week below a person in the 10th percentile.</p>

<p>Newstart recipients are falling into continuously deepening poverty.</p>

<p>Would raising benefits to a more adequate level keep the unemployed out of jobs or even cause low paid workers to give up jobs? Since 1996, the level of Newstart for a single person has fallen from 54% to 45% of the after-tax minimum wage.</p>

<p>It is difficult to see how going back to the 1996 relativities between Newstart and the minimum wage would pose serious disincentives to work. Do we really believe that people need to be impoverished in order to maintain incentives to work?</p>

<p>Currently, single unemployed adults receive $490 per fortnight in Newstart payments, or $35 per day. If they’re renting privately, they’re entitled to up to $120 per fortnight in rent assistance. But, to get that amount their rent has to be more than $267 per fortnight, leaving them with just $24.50 per day for everything else; and that assumes you can find somewhere to rent for $267 a fortnight.</p>

<p>The NSW government’s <a href="http://www.housing.nsw.gov.au/About+Us/Reports+Plans+and+Papers/Rent+and+Sales+Reports/Latest+Issue/">Rent and Sales Report</a> found that in late 2011, the cheapest one-bedroom homes in Sydney’s outer ring were in Wyong – around 90 kilometres from the CBD. If you were on Newstart and paying rent for a one-bedroom property in Wyong, you would have just $17.15 a day left over for your food, clothing, transport and other bills.</p>

<p>If you were paying a typical rent for a one-bedroom flat in Liverpool, 40 kilometres from the CBD, you would have less than $10 a day for everything else.  While nearly 30% of Newstart recipients are under 25 and may be able to live with their parents, 36% are over 40 years of age, and are not likely to have this option.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/newstart-benefit-fails-even-to-pay-the-rent-20120416-1x3sw.html">Data released earlier this week</a> from the Tenants Union of Victoria shows that the Newstart unemployment benefit either just meets or fails to pay the median rent for a one-bedroom flat in all capital cities aside from Hobart and Adelaide. This week, as part of the Greens' campaign for a $50 weekly increase to the allowance, Senator Rachel Siewert has <a href="http://rachel-siewert.greensmps.org.au/content/media-releases/greens-senator-faces-early-budget-pressure-newstart">pledged to live on $17 a day</a>, which is what the <a href="http://www.acoss.org.au/">Australian Council of Social Service</a> (ACOSS) says people on Newstart have left for living expenses once rent has been accounted for.</p>

<p>The problems faced by the unemployed were recognised by the <a href="http://www.taxreview.treasury.gov.au/">Henry Review</a> of the tax system, which highlighted the need for a principles-based approach to setting payment levels: “Establishing adequacy benchmarks for transfer payments not considered in the Pension Review would make the system more robust, particularly if the benchmarks were preserved through a common but sustainable indexation arrangement.” This “would mean an increase to base rates for single income support recipients” on Newstart.</p>

<p>The Henry Review also recommended that the maximum rate of rent assistance should be increased and the rent maximum should be indexed by movements in national rents.</p>

<p>This problem is not going to go away. The continuing impoverishment of Newstart recipients is written into legislation and cannot be alleviated without deliberate government policy change.</p>

<p>Current policies are simply going to make the problem more difficult to deal with if decisions are postponed. It is worthwhile remembering that one of the first initiatives of the Hawke Government was to increase the rate of unemployment benefits, recognising that the lack of consistent indexation had made these payments inadequate.</p>

<p>It’s time the current government recognised that Newstart needs to be increased.</p><p><em>Peter Whiteford receives funding from the Australian Research Council.

<p>Swiss scientists who compared 64 children born using IVF techniques and 57 children conceived naturally found that among the former group, 30% of the participants showed high pulmonary arterial pressure and greater blood vessel rigidity at high altitude.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/125/15/1890.abstract">findings</a> are published this week in the journal Circulation. David Celermajer, the Scandrett professor of cardiology at the University of Sydney Medical School, wrote an accompanying <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/125/15/1832.extract">editorial</a> in the same journal.</p>

<p>“When all things are considered, IVF parents shouldn’t be concerned,” Professor Celemajer said. “I think that to put it in perspective, IVF has given them by and large very healthy children, and if this is going to signal a problem, it’s going to signal that those children are going to perhaps have premature heart disease maybe in their 50s or 60s rather than in their 70s or 80s.</p>

<p>“So if you stack that up against the gift of life in the first place, I don’t think that parents should be overly concerned at the moment.”</p>

<p>The Swiss research team, led by scientists at Bern University Hospital, believe the increased risk of heart problems in later life is a consequence of chemical processes while the embryo is still in the Petri dish. Chemicals in the cultures are thought to influence the expression of some genes.</p>

<p>But members of the team pointed out that many non-IVF people bear the same genetic markers.</p>

<p>“We cannot yet be conclusive with a study of 65 IVF children,” one of the researchers, Marc Germond, said.</p>

<p>During IVF, doctors take an egg from the ovaries and then co-incubate the egg with sperm in the test tube. Alternatively, they may inject a sperm directly into the egg to assist with fertilisation. The embryo that this process creates is grown in a culture for a few days and then implanted in the mother’s womb.</p>

<p>Professor Celermajer said that this phase was “an incredibly critical phase of development – those first 10 days after the egg and sperm meet to form an embryo, so much happens to determine normal health that even the subtle changes in the physical and chemical environment can cause very important very important developmental changes in the baby at the end of gestation.”</p>

<p>There were two possible causes for the cellular stress that embryos might experience, he said. One was the physical stress of being picked up, injected or manipulated, and the other was chemical stress related to chemicals in the environment of the test tube or changes in the oxygen level. “Sometimes cells in an environment where it’s ever so slightly more acidic, for example, might experience oxidative stress. In lay terms, this affects energy use by the cells and growth and development in an adverse way.”</p>

<p>But the study was “relatively small”, he said, and did not conclusively demonstrate that people born through IVF would suffer more heart attacks or strokes. “It’s just pointed to an area for potential concern rather than immediate concern.”</p>

<p>“It does indicate that you’re more likely to have high blood pressure, probably more likely to have diabetes and probably more likely in middle age to have a heart attack or stroke, and so the sensible precaution would be to take every healthy measure that’s open to you in regards to diet, exercise and regular check-ups with your GP.”</p>

<p>Also of concern, he said was the possibility that stress experienced by stem cells in the embryo might affect not only blood vessels but other organs as well. “So it is a bit of a clarion call to look at the kidney, liver, brain, lungs and other organs which could also be affected.”</p>

<p>Professor Celemajer described IVF as “a miracle” and stressed that the benefits outweighed the potential risks, but added that the growing body of research provided a “somewhat disturbing signal that manipulating nature in this way may have some adverse results”.</p><img src="//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/6554/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/conversationedu/~4/mJ73u7WYKrU" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>The expected change comes less than 18 months after legislation abolished the $30 application fee for freedom of information requests (FoI) and reduced other charges.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/cost-of-foi-access-looks-likely-to-rise-20120327-1vwv4.html">The recommendation</a> to increase the charges again has been made in a recent <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/news/consultations.html#charges_review">report</a> by the FoI Commissioner Professor <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/about/exec.html">John McMillan</a>.</p>

<p>McMillan recommends that agencies double some FoI charges after the public “inundated” the government with requests. Government agencies had spent $36 million administering the act.</p>

<p>He argues that the government needs to be able to recoup this cost and to stamp out those applicants who are trivialising the process by making hundreds of requests.</p>

<p>But wasn’t the whole point of the FoI reforms to increase access to government information? Reversing these reforms now would be a mistake.</p>

<h2>Why do we have FoI?</h2>

<p>Gaining information in the public interest was the underlying reason for the reforms that came into effect on November 1, 2010 and even before that.</p>

<p>It was fundamental to the original idea of FoI first mooted by Gough Whitlam when he was Prime Minister in the early 1970s.</p>

<p>FoI in Australia has always been a problem.   Grafting a FoI Act on to a Westminster system of Government is not an ideal situation, and the experiment was failing until the 2010 changes were introduced.</p>

<p>But now that it is “working” more or less as intended the Government wants to change it again.</p>

<p>Professor McMillan told The Sydney Morning Herald in an <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/information-revolution-opens-door-to-secrets-20101020-16ud2.html">interview</a> in October 2010 that the introduction of the reforms would “transform government”, because they created a new emphasis on “pro-disclosure.”</p>

<p>So far this has been the case. Much more information held by government agencies has been released. The changes made it easier for applicants to request information.</p>

<p>But by reinstating fees, the reverse will start to happen and FoI will return to its former self.</p>

<h2>What are the alternatives?</h2>

<p>So what can be done instead?</p>

<p>A great example of reforming FoI would be to look at the Queensland model.</p>

<p>Queensland’s FoI Act (known as the <a href="http://www.qld.gov.au/about/rights-accountability/right-to-information/">Right to Information Act</a>) was reformed in July 2009 following <a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/opinion/solomon-foi-review-vital/story-e6frerdf-1111116649085">a review by Dr. David Solomon</a> that was ordered by former Premier Anna Bligh in September 2007.</p>

<p>The Queensland attitude toward FoI has always been a <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/solomon-leads-the-way-with-foi/story-e6frg9bo-1111116606871">“push model”</a> whereby government information is “pushed” out, rather than the public having to “pull” it out.</p>

<p>As a result of the Solomon review, which saw the Queensland Government support (in full or in part) 139 of the 141 recommendations, Queensland has become the most open and accountable government in Australia.</p>

<h2>Leadership needed</h2>

<p>As I stated in an article I wrote for the website <a href="http://www.upstart.net.au/2010/11/05/strong-leadership-required-if-new-foi-reforms-are-to-work/">Upstart</a>, FoI requires strong leadership for change to work.</p>

<p>The attitude and culture of department heads and government ministers under the Bligh government was different – it embraced openness.</p>

<p>This does not seem to be the case at a Federal level – excuses are being created instead of looking at how best to manage the influx of FoI requests.</p>

<p>In saying that McMillan’s claim that certain groups are using FoI in a “regulatory battle with government” could well be true. In one example, an applicant made 700 requests to the Department of Climate Change in just five months.</p>

<p>There should be measures in place to deal with those that use FOI applications to cause trouble.</p>

<p>The example above would be the perfect candidate to be deemed a vexatious litigant.</p>

<p>But deeming people vexatious litigants also has its downside as it could wrongly place a legitimate requester in the wrong category – think the Seven Network’s FoI editor <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2530235.htm">Michael McKinnon</a>.</p>

<h2>Far from perfect but…</h2>

<p>FoI will never be perfect in Australia. It is a law that is fluid and needs to change with time and circumstance. Increasing fees will deter any slim chance it has of evolving into a law that works.</p>

<p>The Gillard Government needs to look at the three key questions underpinning this issue: what are we doing wrong when it comes to releasing information? How can we better inform the public through non-FoI means? And how can we change the culture and attitude of people in government toward FoI?</p>

<p>Increasing fees is not the answer to any of these.</p><p><em>Perrin Brown does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.</em></p><img src="//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/6332/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/conversationedu/~4/vdhEcovURjU" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>For most people, primary school is the place where early interest in science begins or ends. A student that doesn’t engage with science learning early on is unlikely to continue the subject in high school and into university.</p>

<p>The Conversation spoke with teachers, academics and scientists to get their views on the state of primary science education, and to ask how we might best spark the interest of our young, would-be scientists.</p>

<h2>Brian Schmidt, Nobel Prize winner, Australian National University</h2>

<p><strong>What’s needed to make primary science education better? How can we engage children with science?</strong></p>

<p>At the primary level, we need to ensure our teachers are comfortable with the curriculum they’re teaching. We have <a href="http://www.acara.edu.au/default.asp">a national curriculum</a> now and that’s great.</p>

<p>But we need to make sure the teachers who teach that curriculum, who are not trained scientists in most cases, are comfortable with what they need to teach.</p>

<p>And teachers need to have techniques and experiments and ways of exciting the kids. That really means having a good professional development system in place. We should look around the country and see what’s working. Because really, what works in one school will probably work in many schools.</p>

<p>Also, most teachers have access to parents who are involved in science one way or another. And those people, especially if you have a confident parent who has the right training, can be called upon to show why science is important; why it’s exciting.</p>

<p><strong>What effect would better primary science education have and why is it important?</strong></p>

<p>Research indicates that if you do a bad job teaching kids science and maths in primary school it’s extraordinarily hard to get them back on track, no matter what you do in secondary school, and in university for that matter.</p>

<p>People have to interact with technology in any job they do now so you really have to get them started in primary. If you don’t, you’ll never really get them technologically literate.</p>

<p>And then, of course, Australia really does need a large number of skilled people. Losing a large fraction of our current population in years prep through six – students who are damned from ever doing anything in science because of a poor primary school experience – is something we can ill afford as a country.</p>

<p>We don’t have enough of these people now, and to continually lose more and more kids from science and maths over the coming generations will create huge problems.</p>

<p>A lot of kids are getting a good start right now but a lot aren’t. It’s really important to do as well as we can on giving everyone a good start to their science and math education. Best of all, it’s a relatively inexpensive thing to do.</p>

<p>From my perspective, it’s a no-brainer. Australia is performing OK right now in education in an absolute sense, but we’re going backwards faster than any other OECD country. We can’t afford to continue in that vein. Turning science education around needs to be a national goal, now.</p>

<p><strong>Where did your own love of science begin?</strong></p>

<p>My father is a biologist. My parents had me when they were undergraduates, so I really got to see my dad evolve as a scientist. That said, within school I had a really good environment which taught science and taught it well.</p>

<p>The teachers were able to use my dad and other parents of children in the class to help with science. And they used to have little science days where we did a bunch of experiments.</p>

<p>I would have been around third or fourth grade when we spent most of a day doing experiments and activities and my friends and I thought these were great.</p>

<p>And it wasn’t just my parents, it was six or seven sets of parents. I remember also in around second grade my dad dragging the entire class out into a river that went past our school in Montana and fishing out all the little animals that lived in the river.</p>

<p>There were about 30 or 40 different things he was able to fish out. That kind of thing was really eye-opening to me – the fact there was all this stuff going on we didn’t know about.</p>

<p><strong>What’s needed to make primary science education better?</strong></p>

<p>It’s worth noting first that Australia categorically has one of the best science education systems in the world. Despite media reports about slipping on international measures, we’re only comparing ourselves to the 65 countries that participate.</p>

<p>PISA [the OECD’s <a href="http://www.pisa.oecd.org/pages/0,2987,en_32252351_32235731_1_1_1_1_1,00.html">Programme for International Student Assessment</a>] base their rankings on a single test at one point in time. The countries that do worst on the PISA testing drop out of the ranking system.</p>

<p>But as a developed nation we can always look at ways of improving. With teachers, there’s a need for continual professional development of pre-service teachers and also practising teachers.</p>

<p>Research shows that to have any impact on student achievement, you need at least 30 hours of professional development. There are hardly any programs in the world that actually do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.science.org.au/primaryconnections/">Primary Connections</a>, whose <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2011/s3187765.htm">funding was stopped</a> last year, was getting close in that it was several days of targeted professional development.</p>

<p>Students are getting a good grounding in science, and related inquiry skills such as questioning and scepticism. In primary science, we’re talking about four-year-olds to 12-year-olds. And in those early years, the focus needs to be on curiosity and immersion in what science is.</p>

<p>Research shows that students are forming their <a href="http://www.acer.edu.au/documents/AER51_ReimaginingSciEdu.pdf">attitudes to science</a> in the upper-primary, lower-secondary years. So once they have an attitude where they think science is too hard, for example, it’s difficult to change that view.</p>

<p>We also have the issue of equity as well. As you go down the socio-economic strata, sadly there’s a firm correlation between the resources available to schools and the students' socio-economic status.</p>

<p>The other issue outside of school is the public’s perception of the importance of science education. For me, it’s as important as literacy. But there’s almost, dare I say it, an anti-science sentiment in some parts of the community.</p>

<p><strong>What effect would better primary science education have and why is it important?</strong></p>

<p>Many of the big issues Australian society is going to be facing in the future are around science and technology, energy, resources and climate change. All of these require students to engage with science.</p>

<p>Every decision you make, especially in a technological society like our own, harks back to your understanding of science. Students should leave primary school with a positive attitude to science and a grounding in some of the basic concepts.</p>

<p><figure class="align-right"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/8618/width237/bgnvkfdf-1331770628.jpg"><figcaption>Kids enjoy science when it's hands-on. <span class="source">Flickr/martincron</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>If students turn off science by upper-primary, they are really limiting themselves from a lot of future careers. We find in WA that in a given school district, you might not have a single student able to enter medicine or engineering courses at university because they haven’t studied science in year 11 and 12. It’s not because of a lack of ability.</p>

<p>Without good primary science education, you’re really limiting those students' future career prospects.</p>

<p><strong>Where did your own love of science begin?</strong></p>

<p>I grew up in a mining town in Tasmania, so I did have a thought I would become a geologist. I had a science teacher who was very encouraging in year seven and eight. In year nine I moved to King Island, and my science teacher there encouraged me to enter a science talent search competition. They gave me a book on astronomy, which I still have.</p>

<p>Then I went on to do a science degree and worked in medical research. Then I became a science teacher, did a masters and a PhD. I realised that as a science teacher I could influence the students I teach, but if I moved into academia, I could influence teachers. So I started to teach pre-service teachers to become primary school teachers.</p>

<p>I truly believe a good society has a responsibility to educate its young people. And part of that is giving them the skills to live their lives and contribute back to society.</p>

<h2>Alwyn Powell, winner of the 2005 Prime Minister’s Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in Primary Schools</h2>

<p><strong>What’s needed to make primary science education better?</strong></p>

<p>I work in a primary school and it changes – there’s not a single way to better teach students in primary school and engage them with science. There is a seven-year range from very young children to those beginning high school and those children have diverse needs.</p>

<p>In their early childhood, we should be getting kids involved in play with the environment around them, both the biological environment as well as the physical. The students enjoy that and it does two things: increases their vocabulary of the world around them and it also increases science observation skills.</p>

<p>Once upon a time we used to teach observation skills in science, but that got overtaken with data analysis. When children are young, they are curious and interested in their world, especially when they can talk about what they observe and engage with.</p>

<p>We need to be doing more of that and focus less on writing assessments. We don’t need them to be colouring lots of sheets and answering lots of questions just for the sake of assessment. Young children need to enjoy the world to become passionate about it.</p>

<p>With the older children we need more hands-on and minds-on type of science, particularly with chemistry and physics. But we can’t lose sight of biology – that’s also a critical part of science.</p>

<p><strong>What effect would better primary science education have and why is it important?</strong></p>

<p>We have a static or declining number of students studying science in high school, and it’s <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/k21877254j41816r/">the decline in students' interest in science</a> from the primary school to secondary school that causes some concern.</p>

<p>We’re reducing the number of scientists at the same time we’ve got people saying we need more creative science and people who need a scientific background. US President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/higher-education/building-american-skills-through-community-colleges">indicated</a> that “jobs requiring at least an associative degree are projected to grow twice as fast as those requiring no college experience”.</p>

<p>Science is not seen as fun and enjoyable any more: we’re too busy focusing on the theoretical side of things. In physics for example, students talk and learn about theories of physics rather than how can we use these, how can we make something and then test it. Doing mathematical calculations ad infinitum has no real relevance or meaning to the students.</p>

<p>The experiences of early scientists are exciting for children and teach basic concepts such as pendulums, paper bags going up chimneys and making models. (Observing pendulum models are now a part of a first year introductory physics course at university.)</p>

<p><strong>Where did your own love of science (teaching) begin?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve moved away from saying I’ve got a passion for teaching science. Now I’ve got more of a passion for learning generally. One of the cornerstones for anyone who’s passionate about learning is a way of knowing through science.</p>

<p>I have worked for more than 30 years in teaching including early and middle school years, in pre-school and in year one. You can see young children are enthused – they want to explore and have discussions about what they find and what it means. And seeing that is just a marvel.</p>

<p>I tell a story about a teacher in year one who was working with the children and they were doing geology. Geology is one of those subjects that is falling off the horizon, but these kids would go into the playground and would look for different sorts of rocks and talk about what they learnt in class.</p>

<p>They were extending their knowledge and understanding, they weren’t being assessed. The children were just actively engaged in their learning process – they wanted to learn.</p>

<p>In the middle years, it’s been great working with the kids on science models, using bits and pieces they can use to explain their understanding. The models can look at how a motor works, for example, or how a merry-go-round works. When they make models of it, they can more readily explain it and they play with it outside of school hours.</p>

<p><strong>What’s needed to make primary science education better?</strong></p>

<p>The key to science education in primary schools is motivation – for staff and students. An exciting class will inspire both students and teachers to learn and to immerse themselves in the topic.</p>

<p>In my experience, this is best achieved through the provision of outstanding teacher resources and a faculty that is committed to making science exciting in the classroom environment.</p>

<p>Programs such as Primary Connections [see above] have been fantastic in achieving this. Engaging kids with science is easy – teachers just need to remember to always relate science ideas back to their everyday lives.</p>

<p>My best science lessons are the ones where you know students can’t wait to get home to tell their family about their new discovery about how things work, or why things happen in their everyday life experience.</p>

<p><strong>What effect would better primary science education have and why is it important?</strong></p>

<p>A poor experience in primary science will undoubtedly deter further science studies. It is the responsibility of primary educators to pave the way for scientists of the future.</p>

<p>The reverse is also true – an inspiring, quality science education at primary level will give a student the tools and desire to continue their science journey.</p>

<p>The world is a rapidly changing environment and we need inspired scientists to continue the process of discovery across all sectors – from health and medicine to information technology. We should always remember that it all starts with the primary school education experience.</p>

<p><strong>Where did your own love of science (teaching) begin?</strong></p>

<p>I was not always drawn to science and, to be honest, it was not among my favourite subjects at school. I always had an interest in the way things worked, but I was certainly no scientist.</p>

<p>As I progressed in my teaching, I began to explore science education and I realised that what was missing for me – and many of my colleagues – was inspiring resources to make science fun and interesting.</p>

<p>So I guess you could say my love for science was fostered early in my teaching career as I began to see the impact on student outcomes of exciting science classes. For me, the most gratifying thing about my science teaching is when former students go on to pursue science-based careers.</p>

However, the island of Tasmania stands out from this record: it has not lost a single mammal species since the demise of the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine.</p>

<p>The Ireland-sized island has long acted as a refuge for its <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/boblewis/1942178054/">platypuses</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/madfish_wa/5257727430/">echidnas</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chatallot/293699780/">devils</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/madfish_wa/5257119793/">quolls</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zosterops/5498888992/">bandicoots</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25312294@N00/1752306119/">bettongs</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dmmaus/338891164/">potoroos</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ron-alenka/3208354216/">pademelons</a>. Yet with current and future stresses – such as the introduction of the European fox, disease, urbanisation and climate change – it is critical that those charged with the fauna’s protection continue to monitor their genetic health.</p>

<p>The Tasmanian devil currently receives the lion’s share of conservation attention given its precipitous population decline as a result of the <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/saving-the-tasmanian-devil-if-not-by-selective-culling-then-how-3714">devil facial tumour disease</a> (DFTD).</p>

<p>It is absolutely clear now that the devil’s failure to resist this <a href="http://www.tassiedevil.com.au/tasdevil.nsf/folder/_thedisease">transmissible cancer</a> is linked to its genetic history. Scientists have demonstrated a lack of genetic variation in this species using three different measures. They have compared the complete nuclear and mitochondrial genomes between individuals and counted the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21709235">total number of DNA differences</a>. They have looked at the number of disease recognition genes <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17911263">known as MHC</a> (major histocompatability complex). And they have monitored the distribution of repetitive DNA elements <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15245394">known as microsatellites</a>. Importantly, each of these different measures indicates low genetic diversity.</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9752/width668/j8fxgw97-1334792862.jpg"><figcaption>All measures of genetic diversity suggest the Tasmanian Devil is running low. <span class="source">AAP</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Limited genetic variation within populations may not lead to easily observable problems such as DFTD. The cheetah is a classic example of a highly successful species with lower than average genetic diversity. However, any conservation or population biologist would tell you that low diversity is undesirable because it restricts the capacity of species to respond to local stresses (such as a new illness).</p>

<p>In a study <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035433">published in PLoS ONE</a> today, we used ancient DNA techniques to demonstrate that the Tasmanian tiger population was also genetically poor prior to its extinction. We compared gene coding and non-coding portions of mitochondrial DNA to estimate population diversity from museum specimens collected between 102 and 159 years ago. Approximately half of our samples were collected before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylacine#Extinction_in_Tasmania">bounty of 1888</a> and half afterwards.</p>

<p>Within the gene non-coding DNA, which normally shows about 1.7% variation in mammals and can be as high as 3.5% in some dog populations, there was only 0.5% variability between individual thylacines. Furthermore, our estimate of gene coding diversity was about the same as that found in today’s devil population.</p>

<p>Together, these studies point to a general lack of genetic wealth within Tasmania’s two largest carnivorous marsupials that may originate from the separation of the island from Australia approximately 10-13 thousand years ago at a time when the climate also became warmer. The critically endangered <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nswnationalparks/6638247475/">mountain pygmy possum</a> is an example of a mainland species that has been affected both by isolation and changing climate.</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9753/width668/ggzf57s8-1334793042.jpg"><figcaption>Other isolated species, like Tasmania's eastern quoll, may face similar problems. <span class="source">Chuan Chew</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Before the separation of Tasmania from Australia, thylacines and devils roamed over the entire continent. One pattern that is identified consistently in island populations, or populations that began with a small number of founder individuals, is that they possess very limited genetic diversity. The available pool from which they can draw unique traits has been instantly reduced.</p>

<p>This pattern may not end with the Tasmanian tiger and devil. Tasmania’s other precious fauna may have also inherited a paucity of unique genes that leave them vulnerable to the combined environmental stresses mentioned above.</p>

<p>To clarify the genetic position of many of Tasmania’s other mammals we should be measuring indices of population health relative to mainland Australian populations. Our study in PLoS ONE demonstrates that this is even possible from old specimens, of which there are numerous samples sitting in our museums.</p>

<p>Studies like these are necessary in order to extinction-proof Tasmania’s fauna by describing current levels of gene variation and promoting management strategies that maximise out-breeding and genetic diversity.</p><p><em>Brandon Menzies does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.</em></p><img src="//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/6532/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/conversationedu/~4/8OI1n9urwyM" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>The reddish, inflamed and swollen reactions to bites result from an injection of insect saliva. This is a chemical cocktail of substances designed to make blood flow quickly and painlessly to the bug as it tries to get its fill and avoid being squished.</p>

<p><figure class="align-right"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9669/width237/smttfc6j-1334624867.jpg"><figcaption><span class="source">James West</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>As is the case with any environmental, food or chemical allergen, everyone has a different allergic response to insect saliva. That makes it pretty much impossible to identify the culprit from skin reaction alone. But it probably doesn’t really matter too much because treatment isn’t bug-specific.</p>

<h2>Scratch management</h2>

<p>A recent paper in <a href="http://dtb.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/dtb.2112.0099">Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin</a> looks into how we commonly manage insect bites. It highlighted the scarcity of quantitative scientific studies into the various treatments for insect bite reactions.</p>

<p>The authors found that the few published papers reported little evidence that currently recommended over-the-counter remedies in the United Kingdom for simple insect bites actually work. But they acknowledge that such medications may offer some relief for the discomfort associated with insect bites.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200911/200911beach.pdf">recent Australian study</a> also found insect bites were commonly managed with similar over-the-counter medications.</p>

<h2>But does it work?</h2>

<p>First and foremost, it’s important to avoid insect bites. Notwithstanding nuisance biting, the transmission of disease-causing pathogens associated with insect bites is a major cause for concern in some areas of Australia.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="http://medent.usyd.edu.au/arbovirus/mosquit/repellent_guidelines_2011.pdf">range of strategies</a> that can be used indoors and outside to beat biting insects. They include using insecticides, topical insect repellents and physical barriers such as fly screens and bed nets. But what happens if a pesky insect slips past our defences?</p>

<p><figure class="align-centre"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9506/width668/6xgjzgns-1334194112.jpg"><figcaption>The common brown house mosquito, <em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em>, is responsible for many of the bites we receive while asleep at night. <span class="source">Stephen Doggett, Medical Entomology, Westmead Hospital</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>A mild reaction to an insect bite will probably resolve itself within a day or two without any need for treatment. And if there’s discomfort caused by swelling or itchiness, a cold compress can often provide sufficient relief. But, in some cases, the use of a topical steroid may assist in reducing inflammation and an antipruritic may relieve itchiness.</p>

<p>Oral analgesics or antihistamines may provide relief for serious reactions but it’s probably best to discuss the most suitable products with your doctor or pharmacist. Antibiotics are rarely required for insect bites alone – generally only if a secondary infection occurs.</p>

<h2>Bite-ridden children</h2>

<p>Reactions to insect bites can often be worse in young children. Their little bodies haven’t had a chance to build up immunity so they’re more likely to react more noticeably than older children and adults. This adds an extra level of anxiety in their carers.</p>

<p>But the worst result of most insect bites is largely self-inflicted from scratching. Intense itchiness leading to incessant scratching will likely result in broken skin and secondary bacterial infection. This can become difficult to deal with but despite many reactions among children appearing quite dramatic, serious outcomes from insects bites are relatively rare.</p>

<p><figure class="align-left"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9645/width237/4mks9ny9-1334553143.jpg"><figcaption>Children are often have more severe reactions due to a less built up immune system. <span class="source">maryfrancesmain/ Flickr</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The most important thing is to ensure that the bite site is kept clean and dry, and scratching is kept to a minimum. As soon as the skin is broken, there’s a chance of secondary infection that may result in a more significant reaction requiring antibiotics.</p>

<p>Most children’s reactions to insect bites will naturally become less dramatic as they get older.</p>

<h2>Home remedies</h2>

<p>There’s a whole host of home remedies purported as effective treatment for insect bites. These range from essential oils to mixtures of bicarbonate soda, but there’s no scientific evidence that they’ll provide relief. Most importantly, many home-made concoctions run the risk of causing a skin reaction themselves.</p>

<p>With insect bite skin reactions varying so greatly between people, it’ll always be difficult to have a “one-size-fit-all” approach to their treatment. Some medications may provide relief from severe allergic reaction. but for the majority of cases, that annoying, itchy little bite will just have to resolve on its own.</p><p><em>In his position with Medical Entomology, University of Sydney and Westmead Hospital, Cameron provides advice to local, state and federal authorities on arthropods of public health concern.

last week are less interesting than the political undercurrents swirling around this event.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the UN <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/world/un-toughens-sanctions-20120417-1x5lj.html">announced increased sanctions</a> for North Korea as a response to the launch, but this may not make much of a difference.</p>

<p>The rocket’s explosion has spared the United States and its regional allies some loss of face while for North Korea, it represents a missed opportunity for Pyongyang to maximise its diplomatic and strategic leverage, over and above any threat to Kim Jong-un’s legitimacy as leader.</p>

<h2>Domestic politics</h2>

<p>The failed test is unlikely to represent a hammer blow to Kim Jong-un’s legitimacy as North Korean leader, but it may yield clues about the machinations of North Korea’s leadership transition.</p>

<p>For Kim Jong-un, the importance of the launch probably lay in the commitment it signalled to the military, the most important institution of the state. In this context, the failure of the test is a technical problem of limited relevance to succession politics. The important point for Kim’s legitimacy is that the test was conducted in the first place.</p>

<p>While a blow to national pride, the exploding rocket is unlikely to have stirred the passions of the average North Korean immersed in the daily grind of survival. Just as the explosion of Space Shuttle Columbia meant little for the standing of US President George W Bush in 2003, it is doubtful that the Unha-3 failure has altered the opinion of Kim Jong-un among the masses, being too far removed from their everyday experience.</p>

<h2>Foreign policy</h2>

<p><figure class="align-right"><img src="https://c479107.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/9761/width237/yjns6c6g-1334799570.jpg"><figcaption>The Unha-3 booster rocket waits at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station before the failed mission. <span class="source">EPA/KCNA</span></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Domestic politics notwithstanding, the international community was presumably the primary audience for the Unha-3 launch. The failure of the rocket was a blow to Pyongyang because of the negative signal it sent regarding the technical progress of its missile program and therefore the operability of its nuclear weapon capability.</p>

<p>Nuclear weapon states enjoy greater prestige and diplomatic clout in international relations as a result of their nuclear weapon capability.</p>

<p>A successful test would have demonstrated the viability of North Korea’s long-range missiles as a nuclear delivery system, boosted the deterrence value of its nuclear weapon capability and increasing its strategic and diplomatic leverage in relation to its northeast Asian neighbours.</p>

<p>The failure of the Unha-3 launch diminishes North Korea’s “nuclear shadow” — the impact of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons on its diplomatic relations with other states — along with its ability to use this event as a bargaining chip to extract further aid from the international community.</p>

<h2>International community dodges a bullet</h2>

<p>The UN sanctions, as with past responses to North Korean provocations, reflects the unique limitations bounding nuclear diplomacy on the Korean peninsula.</p>

<p>The use of force is off the table due to significant constraints on military action in the Korean theatre. Due to its close proximity to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), Seoul is essentially indefensible against North Korean rockets and artillery.</p>

<p>The estimated <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB859.pdf">cost of war and reunification</a> should an American military action escalate to full-scale war is estimated in the trillions of dollars and millions of lives, borne largely by South Korea. For any rational military strategist, the risks of an armed response to North Korea’s pin-prick provocations are too great.</p>

<p>The ability of regional states to influence Pyongyang through economic sanctions has been similarly ineffective.  A variety of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/20/us-korea-north-sanctions-idUSTRE64J64520100520">sanctions</a> have been imposed on North Korea, which have restricted its trading relationships to interactions with only a handful of countries and limited its export income.</p>

<p>But the sanctions regime has been ineffectual because North Korea has limited links to the global economy over which the US government has leverage, and where linkages do exist, other Northeast Asian states have shown limited enthusiasm for enforcement.</p>

<p>A united front among regional states is vital to the success of international pressure, however unity is hard to come by in a region characterised by the emerging hegemonic contest between the United States and China.</p>

<h2>Lacking the means to compel</h2>

<p>Regional states lack the necessary strategic and economic leverage to decisively influence North Korean decision-making. The international response to North Korea’s Unha-3 rocket launch should be understoof with this in mind.</p>

<p>The lack of regional consensus gives Pyongyang great leverage in regional diplomacy and provides space for the regime to engage in provocative behaviour, in the knowledge that angry rhetoric and a clumsy sanctions regime are the worst it has to fear as a response from the international community.</p><p><em>Benjamin Habib does not work for, consult to, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has no relevant affiliations.</em></p><img src="//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/6511/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/conversationedu/~4/RZklTAHtLbk" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>The <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature10983.html">research</a> by British and Canadian scientists, published today in the journal Nature, is the largest global gene study of breast cancer tissue ever performed, and the culmination of decades of research into the disease.</p>

<p>Carlos Caldas, one of the authors and the chairman of cancer medicine at the University of Cambridge, said the results would “pave the way for doctors in the future to diagnose the type of breast cancer a woman has, the types of drugs that will work, and those that won’t, in a much more precise way than is currently possible.”</p>

<p>Breast malignancies are diagnosed in almost <a href="http://www.wcrf.org/cancer_facts/women-breast-cancer.php">1.4 million women</a> a year worldwide, and are especially prevalent in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and north America, according to the World Cancer Research Fund.</p>

<p>They are the most common type of cancer among Australian women, and the second most common cause of cancer-related death after lung cancer, <a href="http://canceraustralia.nbocc.org.au/breast-cancer/about-breast-cancer/breast-cancer-statistics">figures</a> show. The number of women diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia increased from 5291 in 1982 to 12,567 in 2007, and is forecast to rise again to 15,409 in 2015.</p>

<p>Sandra O’Toole, a Clinical Associate Professor from the University of Sydney Medical School, said the new findings were “very powerful” because they “present new information on genes that might give rise to new targeted treatments in the future. For example one subtype of breast cancer looks to be influenced strongly by the immune system which may lead to new approaches to treatment.”</p>

<p>Until now, doctors have classified tumours into one of four types by looking at the tissue under a microscope. The category of tumour has provided a guide to how long a woman is likely to survive and which drugs to use.</p>

<p>But doctors were at a loss to explain why, in some cases, treatments turned out to be ineffective, and in others, supposedly dangerous tumours proved easy to beat.</p>

<p>The researchers, from Cancer Research UK’s Cambridge Research Institute and the BC Cancer Agency in Vancouver, believe their findings have solved the mystery.</p>

<p>The team analysed the DNA and RNA of 2,000 tumour samples from women diagnosed with breast cancer between five and 10 years ago, and were able to classify breast cancer into at least 10 new subtypes grouped by common genetic features that correlate with survival. The new classification could change the way drugs were tailored to treat women with breast cancer, they said.</p>

<p>The team also discovered several new breast cancer genes that drive the disease, all of which were potential targets for new types of drugs.</p>

<p>Tests to diagnose the new subtypes could be ready and in regular use in three to five years, Professor Caldas said. “It’s surely going to change the way we do clinical trials. It will lead to better treatments and more targeted treatments.”</p>

<p>“We’ve drilled down into the fundamental detail of the biological causes of breast cancer in a comprehensive genetic study. Based on our results, we’ve reclassified breast cancer into 10 types – making breast cancer an umbrella term for an even greater number of diseases.</p>

<p>“Essentially we’ve moved from knowing what a breast tumour looks like under a microscope to pinpointing its molecular anatomy – and eventually we’ll know which drugs it will respond to.</p>

<p>“The next stage is to discover how tumours in each subgroup behave – for example, do they grow or spread quickly? And we need to carry out more research in the laboratory and in patients to confirm the most effective treatment plan for each of the 10 types of breast cancer.”</p>

<p>Professor O'Toole added the study was “very powerful as it uses a very large number of cancer samples and tests the results in two different, large groups of patients, giving greater confidence in the findings.”</p><img src="//counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/6541/count.gif" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"/><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/conversationedu/~4/pK6bonLh2d8" height="1" width="1"/>";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:4:"type";s:4:"html";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:5:"en-US";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:12:"

<p>But is there a direct link to be made between surpluses and lower interest rates? The Conversation asked three economists.</p>

<p><strong>Graham White, Senior Lecturer, School of Economics at University of Sydney</strong></p>

<p>The short answer is there is no economic argument there. This would be the economic argument the government has put up in response to claims that it’s goal of a budget surplus is purely political, but the connection between the budget balance and the level of interest rates is at best tenuous. And that’s putting the glossiest version on it.</p>

<p>Interest rates for a start depend largely on what the Reserve Bank is doing and they’ve got their eye on inflation, so the only way the surplus could influence interest rates on that score is if it could influence what the Reserve Bank thinks might be happening with inflation. And that’s a real long shot.</p>

<p>Any influence on inflation comes down to whether the government is stimulating the economy or whether it’s slowing expenditure out of the economy. That may influence economic activity and perceptions by the RBA about inflation and what they might do about interest rates. But that’s not the same as the budget balance.</p>

<p>The budget balance might reflect what the government is doing in a discretionary way –  whether it is deliberately increasing expenditure or what have you, or deliberating decreasing expenditure and increasing taxes – but it depends on a lot of other things, such as the way the economy is moving. The budget balance is never completely under the government’s control.</p>

<p><strong>Tim Battin, Senior Lecturer, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, School of Humanities at University of New England</strong></p>

<p>There is no empirical or conceptual basis on which one can claim any strong or direct connection between deficits or surplus on the one hand and higher or lower interest rates on the other. That’s especially the case when we’re in the situation we’re now in, where broadly speaking the economic conditions should dictate to a government that they need to be very, very careful about moving the economy out of deficits too quickly.</p>

<p>Many economists would agree that it is very clear that we need to continue with deficits for the time being, and others would certainly be at least very wary about being too gung ho about a surplus.</p>

<p>The evidence of any indirect link (between surpluses and interest rates) that some people cite is mixed – if anything, it’s really the debt burden that matters, not deficits from year-to-year. Australia’s debt burden is low.</p>

<p>As we learnt during the global financial crisis – and as the wiser economists have been telling us years before that – governments need to engage in counter-cyclical demand management, which in common language means being willing to spend when there is a need to do so. That’s going to happen from time to time. It really is quite puzzling from one angle to look at the government being panicked towards moving to a surplus, when there is no need for it – to say the least – and when it may be quite harmful.</p>

<p><strong>Sinclair Davidson, Professor of Institutional Economics at RMIT University</strong></p>

<p>It is <em>possible</em> that a surplus will deliver lower interest rates but unlikely. If we think back to the early years of this century, the Howard government delivered surplus after surplus, yet interest rates rose on average.</p>

<p>It is possible to argue that interest rates were lower than than they otherwise would have been, but we should be wary of a mechanistic understanding of interest rates. At the same time the government should be applauded for their determination to bring the budget into surplus.</p><p><em>Sinclair Davidson has received funding from the Australian Research Council.
